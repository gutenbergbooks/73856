<p>“Dear sister and Aunt Lucy, oh, please do let me
come home! Ferndale is horrid, the lonesomest old
hole I ever saw in my life, and Aunt Thalia is a real
old dragoness! And I’m tired of behaving like a
grown-up lady, and just dying for some sort of a lark.
And although I don’t like her much, I hate to fool her
as I’m doing. It makes me feel mean as if I were a
regular little fraud. I try to keep it up for your sake,
Lou, but it goes hard. Bother the money! It isn’t
worth the deceit, or, as our old French governess used
to say, ‘<i>Le jeu ne vaut pas la chandelle!</i>’ Can’t you let
me off now? I’ve been here two weeks, and I don’t
think I can stand it any longer! It’s like a catacomb,
so deadly lonesome! Not a caller since I came, and I
haven’t seen a man for two weeks except the gardener
and the old black coach driver! But that’s all the better,
since my clothes are shabby anyhow! I think
Aunt Thalia must have noticed that my red cashmere
is out at elbows, for this morning she actually gave me
forty dollars, and told me to go into town and buy
myself a summer silk and her maid would make it for
me this week. But I’m going to post this letter to you
instead with the money registered to you (as you told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
me to do). I expect she will be fearfully angry when
she finds it out. No doubt she will want to drive me
away, so you had better send a telegram right off for
me to come home. Say that Aunt Lucy’s sick, or somebody’s
dying—anything—so that you get me away at
once and forever from Ferndale! I shall die of the
blues if I stay any longer! With love to you both,</p>

<p>The Ferndale estate did not deserve the title “horrid
old hole,” as applied to it in that gushing, school-girlish
letter. On the contrary it was a magnificent place
of about a hundred acres—a valley farm, situated a
few miles distant from the historic old town of Lewisburg,
and less than six miles distant from the Greenbrier
White Sulphur Springs. The large, old-fashioned
red brick mansion was almost hidden by a far-spreading
grove of gigantic old forest trees, beneath
whose shade, dark and damp and heavy, flourished the
splendid ferns that gave the place its distinctive name.
But after all, perhaps the dense shade and unavoidable
dampness made the old house unwholesome, for old
Mrs. Barry, its mistress, was an aged, withered crone,
little more than skin and bones, with a temper none of
the sweetest, and her servants as a whole were sour-tempered
too, as if they did not get enough sunshine
on their faces and into their souls. It was this subtle
influence perhaps that made Mrs. Barry’s young guest
vow to herself that she should go melancholy mad if
she stayed much longer at Ferndale.</p>

<p>So with a heart beating high with hope she entered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
the old-fashioned family carriage and was driven into
Lewisburg ostensibly to purchase the silk dress, but in
reality to secretly register and post the letter of entreaty
that was to wring her release from her probation
at Ferndale and insure her speedy return to her
own home.</p>

<p>She rather enjoyed the ride that sunny June afternoon,
up hill and down dale in the jolting carriage over
the rough, mountainous road, and her depressed spirits
rose until she began to feel mildly jolly and hummed a
little tune softly to herself that ended suddenly in an
undeniable whistle of surprise as they came around a
bend of the road and in sight of a picturesque plateau
on which stood a beautiful country residence built of
rough gray stone. There were two towers over which
the pretty American ivy was picturesquely creeping,
and the oriel windows here and there, and jutting verandas,
were in a style of architecture quite unusual to
the country, and betokening both wealth and taste. Our
heroine thought she had never seen anything prettier
than the great gray stone house with its creeping ivy,
and its windows glistening in the sunlight, which had
free play here, for there was a sloping lawn in front
of the house with just enough trees grouped here and
there to add beauty to the scene without at all obstructing
the view.</p>

<p>The girl put her pretty, dark head out of the window
and said, eagerly,</p>

<p>“Who lives there, Uncle Abe?”</p>

<p>The old family servant who had spent all his life in
West Virginia, and knew every place for many miles
around, answered promptly:</p>

<p>“Dat’s de ole Laurens place, honey. Fambly’s all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
in Yurrup now eddicating de darters and de sons.
Mighty rich and proud, all dem Laurenses, missie.
Come uv old English stock and ebry now an’ den some
o’ dere kin dies ober de sea and leabes dem anoder
fortin.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Molly, drawing a long breath, her
piquant face glowing with eager interest.</p>

<p>She looked in something like awe at the beautiful
home of these favorites of fortune.</p>

<p>“I wish I was one of ‘de darters’!” she said,
quaintly.</p>

<p>“Hi, honey!” exclaimed old Uncle Abe, quite reproachfully.
“Ole Mis’ Barry’s niece just as good as
dem proud Laurenses.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Uncle Abe,” answered Molly, demurely, the
mischievous golden brown lights dancing in her big,
dark eyes, and her red lips dimpling with mirth at the
old negro’s family pride.</p>

<p>Then she said, half-questioningly:</p>

<p>“But of course the Laurens family are too proud to
notice any of their neighbors?”</p>

<p>Uncle Abe was too busy with his horses to reply for
a moment or two, but presently he looked around
quite crossly at his interlocutor, and said, severely:</p>

<p>“Miss Looisy Barry, I t’ink you mus’ be c’azy.
Don’t you know dere ain’t nobody better den de Barrys?
I been livin’ long o’ dem as slave and freedman
all my life, me an’ my ole ’oman, and de Barrys is
always de top o’ de pot, or, as ole missus say, <i>cweam
delly cweam</i>. Dat’s F’ench for top o’ de pot, you
mus’ know, chile. As fo’ de Laurenses, dey hab
always been hand and glove wif de Barrys! Umph,
chile, you don’t seem to know nuffin’ ’tall ’bout de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
’portance of your own fambly,” concluded old Abe,
shaking his gray head disgustedly, and turning his attention
wholly to his horses for they had left the gray
stone house out of sight, and were descending a steep
hill now.</p>

<p>Molly Trueheart sat quite still with a distinctly
wistful expression on her lovely girlish face.</p>

<p>“What do I care about the importance of the
Barrys? I know that one of them at least can stoop
to selfish scheming!” she muttered, impatiently. “Oh,
I wish I was well out of this scrape. It is not so
funny masquerading as I thought it would be! I nearly
exploded into a confession when the poor old soul
gave me that money, little fraud that I am!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</h2>
</div>


<p>If she was a little fraud, as she declared herself to
be, she had the frankest, honestest, prettiest face in
the world, and many curious and admiring eyes turned
on her as she alighted from the carriage on reaching
Lewisburg and tripped lightly across the narrow pavement
into the post-office.</p>

<p>After she had duly registered the letter containing
the forty dollars she went into a few stores, where she
looked at summer silks; shook her dark, curly head in
pretended disapproval of the prices, bought a paper of
pins and a neck ribbon, then returned to the carriage
before Uncle Abe, who was exchanging the compliments
of the day with some gossips of his own color,
was half ready to leave.</p>

<p>“Lor’, Miss Looisy, you aine a-gwine yit?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Uncle Abe.”</p>

<p>“Dem hosses aine got rested yit, dat’s a fac’. Doane
you want stay awhile, honey, and call on sum o’ de
fust famblies o’ de town?” wheedlingly.</p>

<p>The girl laughed merrily.</p>

<p>“I don’t know a person in Lewisburg from Adam,”
she said. “Come on, Uncle Abe; you’ve gossiped
enough this time,” and with a resigned sigh the old
darky climbed to his seat again, whipped up the
horses, and set off on the return journey to Ferndale.</p>

<p>Molly Trueheart leaned back in the carriage and
gave herself up to the enjoyment of her own thoughts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
until they again came in sight of the Laurens estate
when she called out to the old driver:</p>

<p>“Uncle Abe, who stays over there when the family
goes abroad?”</p>

<p>Uncle Abe, out of humor at being separated so soon
from his gossip, grunted out crossly:</p>

<p>“Nobody but dem sassy Laurens niggers.”</p>

<p>Molly felt herself snubbed and drew back her curly
head, relapsing into a silence that lasted until she again
crossed the threshold of Ferndale.</p>

<p>Mrs. Thalia Barry was sitting in the wide hall taking
snuff out of a golden snuff-box.</p>

<p>She was a tall, spare woman with a frame that had
originally been strong and stout, although now
dwindled by the encroachments of age and the horrors
of a chronic dyspepsia. She had thin, masculine-looking
features, a false front of waved, white hair, false
teeth, and her small, twinkling, greenish-gray eyes
were partially hidden by gold-rimmed spectacles. She
dressed habitually in soft, thick, gray silk, and pinned
her collar of the yellowest old real lace with a magnificent
diamond brooch. Ill-health had magnified an
already imperious temper; and Molly was not far
wrong when she complained that the aristocratic old
lady was a perfect old dragoness, for she was the terror
of her servants when in one of her “spells,” as
they called them, and even her young visitor had more
than once smarted under the lash of her displeasure.</p>

<p>But she looked up now with some eagerness, and
said in her shrill, curt tone:</p>

<p>“Back so soon? I hope that old rascal, Abe, did not
drive my horses too fast! Well, Louise, come and
show me your silk.”</p>

<p>The pretty, dark eyed girl, in her cheap white dress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
and rustic straw hat, halted in the door-way with a
frightened expression and gazed half appealingly into
Mrs. Barry’s stern, ugly face.</p>

<p>“Well?” said the lady, impatiently. “Do you want
some one to bring your bundle in from the carriage?
Here, Ginny Ann,” to an old negro woman hovering
about the back door, “go out to the carriage and get
Miss Barry’s bundle!”</p>

<p>Molly sprang forward, her frightened expression
changing to one of defiant bravery.</p>

<p>“Oh, aunt, she needn’t go! There’s—there’s no
bundle there! I didn’t buy the dress!” she cried out,
desperately.</p>

<p>“But why?” cried Mrs. Barry in amazement.</p>

<p>And the girl faltered, with hot blushes.</p>

<p>“I didn’t need it, you know.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Barry flew suddenly into a fury.</p>

<p>“Not need the dress, you silly girl, when you have
not a decent rag to your back! What do you mean?”
she stormed, in loud, angry tones.</p>

<p>Molly’s blushes grew hotter still, but they were
those of anger now, and her black eyes blazed as she
retorted:</p>

<p>“Well, if I have nothing but rags, what more do I
need in this old tomb of a place where no one ever
comes from week’s end to week’s end? I know you’ll
be mad, Aunt Thalia, but if you kill me for it, I’ll tell
the truth at once! I sent that money to my sister!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Barry’s face grew purple with wrath. She
stamped furiously upon the carpeted floor.</p>

<p>“Never say that word again!” she burst out fiercely.
“You have no sister.”</p>

<p>“My step-sister, then, Aunt Thalia,” amended
Molly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>A glance of concentrated scorn and anger shone on
her through the glasses of Mrs. Barry.</p>

<p>“Louise Barry, I thought you had more pride than
to claim that girl—the daughter of the low-lived actress,
who wheedled your father into marrying her, his
second wife—your sister! The connection is a disgrace
to you.”</p>

<p>“Hush, Aunt Thalia. You must not talk so to me!”
said the girl, sharply. She had grown quite pale, and
her slender little hands were clinched tightly together.
She bit her red lips fiercely, to keep back burning
words that had rushed to their portals.</p>

<p>Mrs. Barry snorted scornfully.</p>

<p>“You take her part, eh? that low-born brat that her
dying mother saddled on your aunt Lucy. Louise
Barry, I’m ashamed of you, disappointed in you. I
wish now that I had taken you here to live when your
father died, then Lucy Everett would have had to send
Molly Trueheart to the poor-house instead of supporting
her on the money I have sent every year to you.”</p>

<p>The girl stood looking at her with a heaving breast
and eyes dilated with anger. When her aunt paused
the girlish head was lifted proudly, and the young
voice trembling with passion, answered sharply:</p>

<p>“Molly Trueheart’s mother, the low-lived actress,
as you call her, left her daughter a legacy, small, but
sufficient to pay for her board and clothing. She
would not have to go to the poor-house, even if Aunt
Lucy turned her out-of-doors.”</p>

<p>“Oh, indeed; I did not know she was an heiress. I
thought she was a pauper. Why did you send her the
money then, since she did not need it?” sharply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p>“I—I owed it to her, Aunt Thalia,” said the girl
with a defiant air.</p>

<p>“So then the allowance I have made you every year
was not sufficient, and you had to borrow from that
creature?”</p>

<p>“Ye-es, madame,” in a stifled tone.</p>

<p>“Very well, you shall never have that humiliation
henceforth. It is not for Philip Barry’s daughter and
my heiress to undergo such straits. Henceforth your
home will be at Ferndale, and I’ll try to cure you of
all fancy for your low-born connection. I’ll write to
your aunt Lucy tonight and tell her so.”</p>

<p>“I—I won’t stay!” stormed the girl, in sudden passionate
defiance and terror commingled. Her black
eyes blazed as she fixed them on Mrs. Barry’s face.</p>

<p>The old lady gazed at her silently a moment as if almost
paralyzed by astonishment.</p>

<p>“Why, you pert little baggage!” she muttered, then
she made a dart toward the girl and clutched her arm
with fingers that seemed strong as iron. Molly struggled
wildly to get away, but Mrs. Barry held her
tightly.</p>

<p>“Come here, Ginny Ann, and help me!” she called
to the gaping old negress, and between them they
dragged the girl upstairs, where Mrs. Barry deliberately
pushed her into the big garret and locked the
door.</p>

<p>“Stay there, miss, until you come to your senses and
ask my pardon for your impertinence!” she screamed
through the key-hole.</p>

<p>Then Molly heard the departing footsteps of the
grim old lady and her satellite, and realized that she
was locked up like a naughty child in punishment for
her misdemeanor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>She was in doubt whether to laugh or cry at the
preposterousness of the whole thing.</p>

<p>At first she indulged in a burst of defiant laughter
which soon changed to hysterical sobbing. Sinking
down on an old moth-eaten sofa she covered her face
with her hands, and tears rained through her fingers.</p>

<p>“Oh, mamma, my true, gifted, beautiful mamma,
it was bitter to hear you maligned so, and you in your
tragic grave!” she murmured sadly. “And I, your
own daughter, I could not take your part because of
the promise that bound me to keep Louise’s secret.
How can I ever like that proud old woman again?”</p>

<p>Like a grieved child she sobbed herself to sleep in
the musty, close-smelling garret, where quiet reigned
supreme save for the patter of startled mice across the
bare, dusty floor.</p>

<p>Two hours passed, and Ginny Ann, the black
woman, was sent up to inquire regarding the state of
mind of the imprisoned culprit.</p>

<p>“Ole missis wants to know is you sorry fo’ youse
sassiness yet?” she bawled through the key-hole.</p>

<p>There was no reply, and she went down and reported
that Miss Louise was sulking yet, and wouldn’t
answer a word.</p>

<p>“Let her stay until night, then. I guess the darkness
will cure her of her stubbornness,” chuckled Mrs.
Barry, evilly.</p>

<p>But all the same she had sent Agnes Walker, her
maid, back to Lewisburg with old Abe, with instructions
to buy the summer silk and a white muslin besides.
The old lady had very particular reasons for
wanting her niece to have this finery.</p>

<p>And while the prisoner sobbed herself to sleep in
the garret, and Agnes Walker tumbled over silks and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
muslins in Lewisburg, Mrs. Barry had Ginny Ann unpacking
trunks in the dressing-room and hauling out
finery that had not seen the light for years, but which
in the revolutions of fashion’s wheel was as fashionable
now as in the long ago years when Mrs. Barry had
bedecked her form in the costliest fabrics and richest
laces to grace the grand society in which she moved
before she had settled down, a childless widow, at
lonely Ferndale, her dower house, to nurse her grief
for her lost partner and her chronic dyspepsia together
and to make herself a terror to any one who dared dispute
her despotic will.</p>

<p>“Lor’, ole mis, dere’s dat white satting dress you
wore when you went to see de queen ober de water,”
exclaimed old Ginny Ann, as she lifted out a tray and
disclosed beneath a lustrous heap of yellow satin and
flounces of fine point lace. “But, Lor’ A’mighty, it’s
all yallered er layin’. I ’speck I kin bleach de lace all
right by layin’ it out in de dew at night, but dat satting
won’t wash, and it’s jes’ ruinated,” sighing heavily and
rolling up the whites of her eyes.</p>

<p>“There, don’t touch it, you old simpleton!” cried
Mrs. Barry, hastily. “That dress has sacred memories.
I wore it at a Drawing-room in London when I was
presented to Queen Victoria on my wedding-tour, and
on my return home at an Inauguration Ball in Washington,
when our good President, Mr. Fillmore, took
his seat. Shut up the trunk, Ginny Ann. I cannot
cut up that dress even for my niece.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s so, dat’s so, ole mis. De impertent chile don’t
deserbe it!” mumbled Ginny Ann.</p>

<p>“Hold your tongue, sauce-box!” cried her mistress,
irately.</p>

</div>


<p>But Molly Trueheart was not sulking in the garret
as Ginny Ann had reported to her “ole miss.”</p>

<p>She had slept but a little while when she was awakened
by a sound that made her spring to her feet with
a shriek of alarm—the hurrying and scurrying of immense
rats across the attic floor. Her black eyes
opened wide in terror, and she sprang upon the sofa,
and stood watching the loathsome animals as, startled
by her scream, they scampered to their holes.</p>

<p>“Good gracious! There must have been a hundred
of the nasty little vermin!” ejaculated Molly. In
reality there had not been more than a dozen, but her
terrors had magnified their numbers. “Ugh! ugh!
ugh! how they make my flesh creep!” she continued,
shuddering nervously and drawing her skirts close
around her dainty little feet. “And to think that they
might have bitten me in my sleep, the monsters! I
wonder, I <i>do</i> wonder if Aunt Thalia intends for me
to stay here all night! I sha’n’t do it! so there, no, not
if Louise loses every cent of the fortune,” her eyes
sparkling resentfully. “I don’t want my hair to turn
white in one night from terror.”</p>

<p>Stillness reigned again, for the rodents, as much
alarmed by her presence as she was by theirs, were
trembling in their hiding-places. Molly sprang down
and ran over to the window, which, without much difficulty,
she flung open, letting in a flood of fresh air.</p>

<p>At the same moment she clapped her pretty dimpled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
hands together and uttered a cry of mischievous pleasure.</p>

<p>“Molly Trueheart, you limb of mischief, I knew you
would be sure to have a lark if you stayed any longer
at Ferndale!”</p>

<p>Close to that side of the house grew a stately oak
tree that flung out its long, strong arms close to the
window-sill. The large, laughing dark eyes were fixed
on the tree while she spoke, and in another moment
she climbed up into the window, twined her round
white arms about a stout branch, and swung herself
forward with kitten-like agility into the big tree, sliding
from limb to limb until she was securely seated
on a stout branch with her back against the body of
the oak.</p>

<p>“Farewell, my late companions!” she cried gayly,
waving her hand at the window, and thoroughly enjoying
her escapade. “Oh, how delicious this is after
Aunt Thalia’s musty old garret! I think I shall sleep
in this tree all night. The big limbs and thick green
leaves will make me a splendid bed, and—ouch, oh,
Lord have mercy! oh! oh! oh!” and as the last exclamation
left her lips, Molly’s hold on the tree relaxed,
and she went crashing down, with a rustle of
breaking twigs and scattering leaves, through the
branches to the ground, where she lay groaning on the
grass amid the <i>debris</i> collected during her fall.</p>

<p>For, lifting her bright eyes to the higher branches
of the tree, she had suddenly beheld an immense black
snake hanging downward with his tail curled around a
stout twig, and his head thrust forward toward her,
while his keen little eyes glowed in the green obscurity
of the thick leafage like baleful jewels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p>Molly had given such a start and scream of terror
that she had tumbled headlong through the tree at
least twenty feet from the ground, but the soft, thick
grass and the leaves that had fallen with her, had so
broken the severity of the fall that after the first
groan she was able to rise slowly to her feet and exclaim
between laughter and tears:</p>

<p>“‘Och, I’m kilt intirely,’ as Paddy would say. Now
I wonder if I can be having the delirium tremens,
seeing rats and snakes like this! It can’t be, for I’ve
never been addicted to the intoxicating glass! I believe
I’ve broken my arm, it hurts so bad. Good heavens,
it’s coming down the tree! It must be a racer.
I’ll have to cut and run!”</p>

<p>This she did with surprising agility, only pausing to
look behind her once when she saw his snakeship,
which did indeed belong to the racer species, trailing
his shining length rapidly after. With a half sob
in her throat, Molly flew on and on over hay-fields and
hills, fences and brooks, until she had left Ferndale a
mile behind her, and came up with a jerk against some
tall, white palings that inclosed the beautiful lawn she
had admired while riding that day—the Laurens place,
as old Abe had called it in answer to her curious questions.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</h2>
</div>


<p>She paused and looked behind her to see if the
black snake still pursued her, but she had left it far
behind in her headlong race, and to her dismay she
perceived by the brilliant hues of the western sky that
the sun had almost set.</p>

<p>Badly frightened as she had been at first, the sudden
feeling of safety roused in her the sense of the
ludicrous, and Molly laughed aloud at her forlorn
plight. Her white dress was in rags and soiled with
the mud of the little brooks through which she had
splashed headlong, she was bare-headed, her hair all
loose and disordered, and the perspiration ran in
streams down her flushed face.</p>

<p>“What a beauty I must look!” she ejaculated, merrily.
“And I wonder what disaster will befall me next.
I shall have to go and ask one of those ‘sassy Laurens
niggers,’ as Abe calls them, to go home with me, for
I daren’t go alone. I might meet that old snake again.
But they will be frightened, I am such a sight, and
perhaps they will set the dogs on me.”</p>

<p>She sat down on the grass to rest herself before
going in at the gate and to think over the sudden
<i>contretemps</i> that had befallen her after her two weeks
of irreproachable good behavior.</p>

<p>A feeling of remorse came to her at the thought of
her step-sister who might lose so much by the misdemeanor
of the girl she had trusted.</p>

<p>“Oh, why didn’t I bear all and hold my tongue,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
little virago that I am?” she exclaimed. “I knew when
I came that I must take a great deal. Aunt Lucy cautioned
me carefully. Suppose—suppose—old Mrs.
Barry should disinherit Louise for this. <i>She</i> wouldn’t
forgive me as long as she lived, I know, and I couldn’t
forgive myself, either.”</p>

<p>The beautiful young face wore an expression of dismay
and the young heart throbbed with pain.</p>

<p>“Oh, how wicked I have been! How cruel to poor
Louise,” she continued, springing excitedly to her feet.
“My bad temper and love of fun are always leading
me into mischief. But I’ll make it up, yes, I will. I’ll
go and beg the old dragoness’ pardon. Not that she
didn’t deserve all I said, but for Louise’s sake.”</p>

<p>With rapid footsteps she made her way to the servants’
quarters, which she saw some distance in the
rear of the grand mansion. With some trepidation
through fear of dogs, Molly approached the commodious
white-washed kitchen in the door of which sat
an old negress in a homely blue linsey dress with a
red handkerchief twisted turban-wise about her head
and a little black pipe in her mouth.</p>

<p>“Lor’ A’mighty, who dat?” she sputtered, as Molly
came up in her ragged dress, and minus one slipper
which she had dropped in her flight.</p>

<p>“Good-evening, auntie,” said Molly, putting on a
smile like sunshine. “Don’t mind my looks, please. I
fell from a tree and tore my dress, and ran from a
snake and lost my slipper, and I’m so tired and hot
and thirsty, please give me a drink.”</p>

<p>“Sartinly, chile, but did de snake bite ye? ’Cause,
ef he bit you, honey, I better give you some reverend
whisky to cure snake bite!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>“No, I was not bitten, auntie,” said Molly; then
with a quizzical glance: “Isn’t it odd, auntie, that
whisky will make men see snakes but it will cure snake
bites?”</p>

<p>“Go ’long wid yer foolishness, chile,” said old Betsy,
chuckling. She hobbled slowly to a little stone spring
house near by and brought Molly a clean gourd full of
cool, sparkling water. “Whut’s yer name, honey?”
she continued, as Molly drank thirstily of the delicious
draught.</p>

<p>“Will-o’-the-wisp!” said the girl, whimsically.</p>

<p>“Willy Whisk! Soun’s more like a boy’s den a
geerl’s name. But won’t you take a cheer, honey, and
tell me all about you-self?” wheedlingly.</p>

<p>“No, I thank you, aunt—what’s your name?”</p>

<p>“Aunt Betsy Bell, chile—named arter de big mountain,
Betsy Bell,” said the old negress with pride.</p>

<p>“Well, Aunt Betsy, I’m in a great hurry. Won’t
you send somebody with me to Ferndale? I’m afraid
to go alone, it’s getting so dark, and that old snake is
somewhere on the road waiting for me to come, I
know,” with a shudder.</p>

<p>To her dismay the old woman shook her turbaned
head and answered:</p>

<p>“Dere ain’t a soul on de place but me, honey. De
men aine come f’om de corn-fiel’ yet, and my ole man
tuck de ole mare dis morn’ and car’e’ some spring
chickings down to de White Sulphur Springs, and he
won’t git back till de cool o’ de night!”</p>

<p>“My gracious, this is awful,” said Molly, in dismay.
Then she brightened and beamed on the old woman.
“Won’t you go with me, Aunt Betsy?” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Lor’ me, chile, I got rheumatiz too bad! I aine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
walk as far ez Ferndale in two years. My laig all
drawed wid rheumatiz. Set down an’ wait till de men
come from de fiel’s, den you hab company to take you
home.”</p>

<p>“How long until they come?”</p>

<p>“Two, free hours, I ’spect. Dey’s gwine work late,
dey said, tryin’ to git all de corn plantin’ done tonight.”</p>

<p>Molly flung herself down tempestuously on the
kitchen door-step, leaned her dark, curly head against
Aunt Betsy’s linsey knee, and dissolved into stormy
sobs and tears.</p>

<p>Aunt Betsy’s tender heart was touched to its center.</p>

<p>“Lor’ honey, you make me t’ink o’ my little white
chillern I used to nurse, a-comin’ and layin’ deir curly
heads ’g’in deir black mammy’s knee, and cryin’ and
sobbin’! Hush, honey; I’ll fix a way fur ye—on’y
don’t cry so, fur it makes my heart ache, t’inkin’ o’ my
little white nurslin’s ober in dat furrin’ kentry. Now
tell me, honey, Miss Willie Whisk, kin you ride hossback?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” said Molly, unblushingly; for although
she had never ridden horseback in her life, she
said to herself undauntedly:</p>

<p>“I can do it if I try.”</p>

<p>“All right; den I’ll lend you my ole misses’ ridin’
hoss, Miss Willie Whisk, and you kin turn him loose
soon’s you git to ole Miss Barry’s gate, and dat hoss
will come straight home to his stable.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you, Aunt Betsy. God bless you, you
kind soul. I’ll try to pay you for this some day!”
gushed Molly, gratefully, little dreaming how the
keeping of that promise would come to pass.</p>

<p>She went with Betsy to the stable, where the old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
woman brought out and saddled a fine bay horse on
which she mounted Molly. Then she hobbled to a
gate which she threw open, saying kindly:</p>

<p>“Dar’s your road straight to Ferndale. Good-night,
Miss Willie Whisk. Gib my ’spects to ole Miss Barry,
and my lub to Ginny Ann and old Unc’ Abe, her husband,
and to Nancy Jane, and all de res’, and tell ’em
all to come ober.”</p>

<p>“I will, Aunt Betsy. Good-night to you,” Molly
called back cheerily, as the bay horse pranced down
the road in the deepening twilight and starlight.</p>

</div>


<p>“How easy it is to ride horseback! This is perfectly
delicious!” cried Molly, exultantly, as she
gripped the reins in her little white hands, and gave
herself up to the enjoyment of her novel adventure.</p>

<p>A feeling of buoyant delight came to her as she felt
herself borne easily and swiftly along on the back of
the gently pacing and splendid animal.</p>

<p>“Oh, I did not know what I missed in never learning
to ride! I shall get Aunt Thalia to let me have a
horse to go out every day now until Louise sends for
me,” she resolved, gayly.</p>

<p>Alas! she felicitated herself too soon.</p>

<p>They had not made half the distance to Ferndale,
when at a sudden turn of the road some distance ahead,
Molly saw a tall, manly figure coming toward her with
the inevitable fiery tip of a cigar gleaming through the
semi-darkness. At sight of this pedestrian the bay
horse, which had been pacing easily and beautifully,
uttered a loud whinny of delight, and changed his easy
gait for a sudden gallop that took Molly by surprise,
and, losing her balance in the saddle, the reins slipped
from her hands. Another moment and our luckless
heroine went flying over the head of her noble steed
and landed ignobly on her face in the dust of the road.</p>

<p>The bay horse stopped perfectly still with wonderful
equine intelligence and the pedestrian dropped his
cigar and rushed to the rescue.</p>

<p>As he came upon the scene the animal again uttered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
a whinny of delight and poked his cold nose into the
new-comer’s hand.</p>

<p>“What, Hero, old fellow, glad to see me back?” the
gentleman said, with a hasty caress on the graceful
head.</p>

<p>Then he stooped over the heap of huddled-up humanity
in the road.</p>

<p>“What mischief have you done in your haste to bid
me welcome?” he continued, lifting Molly’s dark head
out of the dust.</p>

<p>A moment’s examination assured him that the fall
had either stunned or killed her outright.</p>

<p>“This is dreadful; and whom can it be, anyhow,
riding my mother’s favorite bay?”</p>

<p>While he spoke he was carrying her across the road
to a little spring bubbling between the rocks and ferns.</p>

<p>He laid her down then on the grass and bathed her
face and hands with water.</p>

<p>But Molly lay for many minutes still and speechless,
and he began to grow very anxious as well as curious
over the girl whose face as seen by the light of the
rising moon looked very lovely with its clear-cut, piquant
features, round, dimpled chin, and slender black
brows and thick, fringed lashes.</p>

<p>The man leaning over her was as handsome in his
way as she in hers was lovely. He was tall and stately
looking, with a splendid physique, and a noble, high-bred
face, large eyes that looked black by night, but
by day were blue as the violets of his native hills. His
hair was of a chestnut tinge, and lay in luxuriant
masses about his temples. It was the face of a man
about thirty years old, and the golden brown mustache
shaded lips that were strong, and grave, and proud,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
and perhaps a little stern. In dress and manner he
was the perfect gentleman.</p>

<p>“Whom <i>can</i> she be? I am quite certain that she belongs
to no one in the neighborhood,” he was thinking
for at least the twentieth time, when suddenly a sigh
heaved Molly’s breast, and the dark eyes opened wide
on the face of the stranger.</p>

<p>At first she regarded him in dreamy surprise. Her
head lay on his arm, but she did not seem to notice it,
only murmured, quaintly, and with an air of relief:</p>

<p>“I thought I was dead!”</p>

<p>“I thought so, too, but I am very happy to find that
you are not,” said the stranger in a pleasantly musical
voice. “Tell me, do you feel any pain?”</p>

<p>Molly groaned as she half lifted her form from
where it rested against him.</p>

<p>“I feel as if all my bones were broken. I fell out of
a tree, you know,” she said.</p>

<p>An expression of uneasiness crossed his face.</p>

<p>“It was a horse you fell from—don’t you remember?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“It was not a horse, it was a tree. I think I ought
to know!” returned belligerent Molly.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</h2>
</div>


<p>The stranger regarded Molly’s saucy rejoinder as
the effect of an injury done to her brain by her fall
from the horse, and said to himself, pityingly:</p>

<p>“She evidently struck upon her head and the shock
has disordered her brain, but I trust the affliction will
prove but momentary.”</p>

<p>She was sitting upright now regarding him with
vexed, dark eyes when he said, smilingly:</p>

<p>“Since you dispute my assertion permit me to prove
it. Look yonder!”</p>

<p>Molly turned her head and saw the handsome bay
horse standing still in the road as if conscious of his
misdemeanor.</p>

<p>Her memory came quickly back.</p>

<p>“Oh!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“You remember?” he rejoined.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Her face and eyes looked very arch and saucy as
she continued:</p>

<p>“I suppose you take me for an escaped lunatic?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” with a provoking smile on the handsome
lips, “only a very giddy girl whose memory was temporarily
obscured by her fall.”</p>

<p>“And you don’t like giddy girls?” Molly interrogated,
with a decisive pout.</p>

<p>“Not—usually,” he returned with a sparkle of mischief
in his eyes.</p>

<p>Molly sprang to her feet with considerable agility,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
considering that she had declared she felt as if all her
bones were broken.</p>

<p>“Neither do I like hateful prigs!” she returned,
with asperity. “So I will bid you good-evening, sir.”</p>

<p>Dropping him a pert little courtesy, she ran toward
the horse, but as she lifted her little foot to the stirrup
she found him at her elbow.</p>

<p>“Permit me,” he said, and lifted the light figure
quickly to the saddle.</p>

<p>Then he detained the reins in his hands a moment.</p>

<p>“Do you know I was very much surprised to see a
strange young lady riding this horse?” he said. “I
know the horse and its owner—but—”</p>

<p>“Not the rider,” she finished his hesitating sentence.
“Well, my name is Molly Trueheart, and I borrowed
the horse from old Betsy Bell over there at the Laurens
place. I will send him home in an hour. So, you
see, I’m not a horse thief, although I may look like a
lunatic. To tell the truth I’ve had quite a lark this
evening, and I’m very anxious to get home.”</p>

<p>“A lark!” he repeated, with an expressive shrug,
and Molly Trueheart uttered a merry, rollicking peal
of laughter.</p>

<p>“Yes, a lark!” she said. “Oh, how horrified you
look! Good-night, Mr. Prig!” and like a flash she
caught the reins from his hands, touched Hero lightly
with the whip, and he bounded gracefully away as if
anxious to atone for the mishap of awhile ago.</p>

<p>The stranger stood looking after her with a smile in
his violet eyes.</p>

<p>“What a merry little hoiden!” he uttered aloud,
“and what a mercy she escaped unhurt. It was rather
ludicrous to see her come flying over Hero’s head in
that fashion, and landing in the dust at one’s feet!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>Still smiling, he resumed his walk toward Maple
Shade, as the Laurens place was called, but before he
reached the wide entrance gate of the park he was
overtaken by Hero, who, on being liberated at Ferndale,
had galloped rapidly back to overtake his friend.</p>

<p>“Good fellow!” said the gentleman, springing to the
back of the delighted creature, and continuing his journey.
“I hope, Hero, you have delivered our little
madcap safe at home, and not flung her precipitately
at the head of some other astonished pedestrian!”</p>

<p>Hero gave a delighted whinny which his rider interpreted
as the former, which was indeed the case, for
Molly Trueheart was at that moment running across
the lawn at Ferndale, anxious to make her peace with
old Mrs. Barry.</p>

<p>“I shall have to humble myself down to the ground,
I know, but I’ll do it for Louise’s sake,” she muttered
then. “Oh, dear, how my bones do ache! I know
I’m all over black and blue from the tumbles I’ve had!
I know very well I shall be as sore as a boil tomorrow,
and have to stay in bed all day. Oh, what made Lou
so determined on sending me here? She might have
known,” dismally, “that I could not behave myself.
Oh, Lordy, I do hope she’ll let me off from doing any
more penance as soon as she gets my letter!”</p>

<p>A sudden thought of the dignified stranger she had
encountered made her laugh aloud in spite of her sorry
plight.</p>

<p>“My! what a prig he was! Handsome though,
<i>very</i>!” she said. “I wonder who he was, the wretch?
He frightened the horse, of course, or I shouldn’t have
got that fall. I hope he doesn’t live in this neighborhood,
for it wouldn’t do for Aunt Thalia to find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
out that I ran away. I must hold my peace on that
point. And now to face the music!”</p>

<p>The hall-doors stood wide open, the light of the
swinging-lamp shining on the tired, pretty face of the
girl as she crept in and went softly to the door of her
aunt’s sitting-room. At the same moment the tall
Dutch clock in the hall loudly boomed out the hour
of ten.</p>

<p>“Oh, I did not dream it was so late!” she muttered,
and peeped around the door.</p>

<p>There lay her Aunt Thalia on the sofa with Ginny
Ann mopping her face with camphor, and old Nancy
Jane, the cook, swinging a huge turkey-wing up and
down.</p>

<p>Molly forgot her selfish terrors in anxiety for the
old lady, and rushed precipitately into the room.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>Nancy Jane and Ginny Ann squealed simultaneously:</p>

<p>“Lordy, Miss Lou, dat you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, or what’s left of me after tumbling out of
the tree.” Walking up to her aunt’s side, then bending
over her: “Aunt Thalia, are you sick?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Barry opened her eyes with a look of relief,
but before she could speak Ginny Ann broke in:</p>

<p>“Missis almost c’azy, finkin’ you done runned away.
You sartinly did gib us a skeer, chile! Ole mis’, she
say jes’ now, ‘Run upsta’rs, Ginny Ann, and let dat
chile out o’ dat garret. Guess she sorry for her sass
now.’ And I went and foun’ dat windy wide open,
and you gone. And ole mis’ flew in <i>sech</i> a rage,
umph me, as you nebber saw, and mos’ went inter de
highstrikes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>“Ginny Ann, hold your tongue, you old fool!” cried
Mrs. Barry, sitting upright, with a suddenness that
made her domestics reel backward in dismay. “Is that
you, Louise? Where have you been, child, giving us
such a scare about you?”</p>

<p>Something like tenderness quivered through her
voice despite its acerbity, and cunning Molly took instant
advantage of the situation. She dropped theatrically
upon her knees.</p>

<p>“Oh, Aunt Thalia, the big rats in the garret frightened
me almost to death!” she sobbed. “I climbed out
of the window into the tree, and then a big snake
scared me, and I fell out of the tree down to the
ground, and—and—oh—most killed myself! And—and—it
just served me right, too! I ought to have
been killed for my meanness to you, Aunt Thalia! I
was just as naughty as I could be, but I’m downright
sorry, and I’ll try never—or, ‘hardly ever’—to do it
again. Won’t you please forgive me?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Barry looked down keenly into the lifted face.
It did look pale and pathetic, and the big eyes were
positively dewy. She put out her long, withered hand,
on which a priceless diamond sparkled, and gently
stroked the dark head.</p>

<p>“Louise, I don’t know but that I ought to beg <i>your</i>
pardon,” she said, with a gentleness that was so rare in
her it made the gaping negroes stare. “I—I don’t exactly
think I did right putting you in the old garret.
You—you might have been killed falling out of that
tree! I think we must forgive each other and do
better in future.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you so much, Aunt Thalia!” Molly
cried, jubilantly. She even dared press a timid kiss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
on Mrs. Barry’s wrinkled cheek, she felt so glad that,
by eating humble pie, she had saved Louise.</p>

<p>“Are you bruised very much, my dear?” the old
lady inquired, sympathetically, and Molly responded
lugubriously:</p>

<p>“Black and blue all over!”</p>

<p>Both the negro women groaned in concert at this
statement, and Mrs. Barry exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Oh, how dreadful to think of such a fall! It’s a
mercy you were not killed outright. I forgot about
the rats in the garret, or I never would have shut you
up there. Ginny Ann, you go upstairs with the child,
and let her have a warm bath, then rub her from head
to foot in arnica—from <i>head</i> to <i>foot</i>; do you hear?”</p>

<p>“Yes, ole mis’, sartinly. Come on, Miss Lou,
honey.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Ginny Ann. Good-night, Aunt Thalia. I’m
sorry I gave you such a scare; and I’m so glad that
you were good enough to forgive me,” Molly said, as
she followed Ginny Ann from the room to the bath-room
upstairs, where the old lady’s instructions were
carried out to the letter.</p>

<p>“Oh, I feel so much better! Thank you, Ginny
Ann,” she exclaimed, as the latter tucked her into her
cool, white bed. “But I’m sorry to be so much
trouble.”</p>

<p>“No trouble at tall, Miss Lou. I’se always been use
to waiting on de Barrys. It’s my pleasure and my
dooty,” Ginny Ann replied, with the elaborate politeness
of the well-raised Virginia negro. Then she
paused, and said, mysteriously: “Honey, doane you
mine ole missis’ capers; her bark worser ’n her bite.
She gwine make it up to you fo’ treatin’ you so bad.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>“Make it up to me?” said tired and sleepy Molly,
drowsily; and then Ginny Ann got down on her knees
by the bed and whispered the secret of the evening’s
work among the trunks of finery, and of the maid’s
trip into town for the summer silk.</p>

<p>“Lay low, honey, and doane say a word to ole
missis, but sho’ as you born, she’s gwine take you off
on a trip whar you’ll hab a fine time dancin’ and eberyt’ing;
and I shouldn’t wonder, no, I shouldn’t, ef she
marries you off to some nice young gemplum,” she
concluded, exuberantly.</p>

<p>Molly’s head popped up from the pillow like a cork.</p>

<p>“Indeed she won’t then! Marry me off, indeed! I
should like to see any one try it!” she blazed, indignantly.</p>

<p>“Hi, honey, doane you want get married?” Ginny
Ann inquired, in amazement.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t! I hate men, every one of them—deceitful
<i>prigs</i>!” cried Molly, violently, adding to herself
that the man she had seen tonight she hated worst
of all.</p>

<p>Wanting to get rid of Ginny Ann, she put down
her head again, pretending to snore audibly, and the
woman retired, muttering to herself:</p>

<p>“Dat’s de strangest young gal I eber did see! Doane
wanter git married, she say! Well, Lordy! she sartinly
is diff’runt from any oder young gal in de worl’!”</p>

</div>


<p>Molly did not have any “larks” the next day, for
she was so stiff and sore she had to remain in bed all
day, and submit to the fussy attendance of Ginny Ann,
and the kindness of her remorseful aunt who, blaming
herself for the girl’s accident, did all in her power to
atone for it, even to promising her a month at the
White Sulphur Springs, and freely pardoning her for
sending her money to Molly Trueheart, the actress’
daughter.</p>

<p>“And I sent Agnes Walker back to town yesterday
and bought two new dresses for you,” she said. “And
I’ve trunks full of things as good as new that she’s
going to make over for you to wear.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Aunt Thalia, I don’t deserve ’em, I can’t take
’em,” Molly said, conscience-stricken at all this kindness.
She said to herself reproachfully, “And I wrote
to Lou that she was an old dragoness! What a shame!
She has turned real good, and it makes me feel meaner
than ever. Oh, I can’t take her presents and go to the
Springs with her, and I mustn’t say a word, I must
wait for Lou’s letter. She will certainly let me come
home at once!”</p>

<p>But several days passed and no reply came from the
absent step-sister. Meanwhile the work of dress-making
went briskly on, to the secret distress of the little
fraud, as she called herself when alone.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s too bad, ruining all these fine things cutting
them up for me! I shall never wear them, and they
will not do for Louise, she is so much bigger than I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
am! Oh, why don’t she write and put a stop to it
all?” she thought impatiently, and in her trouble she
wrote another letter, telling Louise of the sacrifice of
the finery, and begging her incoherently to “do something.”</p>

<p>By the time that she could reasonably expect a reply
to this second appeal several very pretty dresses were
completed, and one evening soon after tea when she
had hurried upstairs to have a real good cry over
Louise’s unaccountable silence, she was startled by the
abrupt entrance of Mrs. Barry’s maid with the muslin
dress thrown over her arm.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Barry wants you to dress and come down to
the parlor,” she said.</p>

<p>Molly stared.</p>

<p>“What for?” she inquired ungrammatically.</p>

<p>Agnes Walker shook her head laconically and answered:</p>

<p>“I can’t tell. She wants to see how your new dresses
fit, perhaps, or to give you some lessons in managing
your train. Anyway, she told me to dress you and
send you down.”</p>

<p>“Here’s a lark,” said the merry girl to herself, forgetting
all about her tears of a minute before.</p>

<p>She submitted coolly to Agnes Walker’s help, exclaiming
gayly:</p>

<p>“I should like to see how I look in a fine dress. I
never had one in my life.”</p>

<p>“Fy, Miss Barry,” cried the maid; but Molly persisted
in her assertion.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s very becoming to you, anyway,” said
Agnes, carefully adjusting the graceful demi-train
with its embroidered flounces.</p>

<p>She had tied Mollie’s refractory dark curls back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
from her peach-bloom cheeks with a new rose-pink
ribbon, and fastened a bunch of pink roses in with the
lace of her square corsage. The round dimpled arms,
bare to the elbows, were faultless in shape and contour
as they escaped from their soft ruffles.</p>

<p>“You look very nice,” continued Agnes, critically.</p>

<p>“Thank you; but I feel like a peacock,” said the girl,
with such ludicrous strut across the floor that the
maid burst out laughing.</p>

<p>“Miss Barry, you haven’t got a bit of dignity.
You’re just like a child!” she exclaimed. “But go,
now, to your aunt. You know how impatient she is.”</p>

<p>Molly laughed; but she went along the hall quite
sedately and down the stairs, pausing only once to take
a gratified peep at herself in the mirror of the tall
hatrack opposite the parlor door.</p>

<p>“I do look <i>nice</i>,” she said, nodding at the radiant reflection,
and a sudden thought came to her. She muttered:</p>

<p>“I wish <i>he</i> could see me now, the hateful <i>prig</i>! I
know I <i>did</i> look like a tramp that night.”</p>

<p>With that she crossed the hall, turned the handle of
the parlor door and entered.</p>

<p>A blaze of light greeted her and made her pause in
surprise. The big chandeliers in the double parlors
were both lighted and Mrs. Barry was entertaining a
guest.</p>

<p>She rose with suave dignity.</p>

<p>“Cecil, this is my niece, Louise—Miss Barry, Mr.
Laurens.”</p>

<p>Taken by surprise, Molly made a bashful constrained
little courtesy without looking up, but as she
was about to sink into a seat by her aunt a manly hand
grasped hers and a familiar voice said kindly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p>“I am glad to meet you, Miss Barry. I hope we
shall be as good friends as the Barrys and Laurens
have been before us!”</p>

<p>Molly looked at him with dilated eyes. It was the
stranger she had met a few nights before!</p>

<p>Her lips parted and closed again without a sound.
In pitiable agitation she dropped into a large arm-chair
behind Mrs. Barry, telling herself that he had
betrayed the whole escapade, and that now the old
lady’s wrath would be poured out upon her head in
fullest measure. She waited in sheer desperation for
the blow to fall on her pretty luckless head.</p>

<p>Not a word was addressed to her by either her aunt
or the visitor. Mrs. Barry took up the thread of a
momentarily dropped discourse about London. They
discussed that famous city at some length while the
culprit trembled in her chair.</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Barry’s gray silk rustled as she rose
from her sofa.</p>

<p>“Cecil, you will kindly excuse me for ten minutes,”
she said, suavely; and, like a wise old lady, left them
alone to get acquainted with each other.</p>

<p>Molly drew a long, deep breath that was almost a
sob, and looked up, thinking that she had escaped a
threatening danger.</p>

<p>She thought, happily:</p>

<p>“He does not recognize me!”</p>

<p>But she was mistaken. Cecil Laurens was looking
at her with a quizzical smile.</p>

<p>He drew his chair nearer—beside her, in fact—and
said, reproachfully:</p>

<p>“You said your name was Molly Trueheart—”</p>

<p>“Oh, hush!” cried Molly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>She almost jumped out of her seat in her terror lest
Mrs. Barry should have heard his words.</p>

<p>“I——I—told you—a—a story, Mr. Laurens,” she
said, tremulously. “But please, <i>please</i> don’t tell Aunt
Thalia!”</p>

<p>The violet eyes under the dark brows and high,
white forehead regarded the pleading face rather
sternly.</p>

<p>He said:</p>

<p>“Then your aunt did not know of your—your—”
hesitating, then half smiling, “your ‘lark’ that night?”</p>

<p>Molly grew hot and angry under that peculiar smile.</p>

<p>“I don’t see what you’re smiling at,” she said, crossly.
“No, she doesn’t know; and—if—you—are—a
gentleman—you will not betray me!”</p>

<p>He flushed as the slow, emphatically uttered words
fell from the girl’s lips, and answered, curtly:</p>

<p>“I claim to be a gentleman, Miss Barry, but I can
not comprehend the motives of a <i>lady</i> who goes on such
a madcap race by night unknown to her guardians,
and under a fictitious name!”</p>

<p>The sarcasm in his voice stung deeply. Molly
turned crimson and exclaimed, resentfully:</p>

<p>“It is <i>not</i> a fictitious name—it is my own—my step-sister’s
name, and I have a right to use it if I choose!”</p>

<p>Cecil Laurens queried, gravely:</p>

<p>“Do you think your step-sister would be willing to
allow such an escapade to go under her name?”</p>

<p>Tears of shame and anger flashed into Molly’s dark
eyes.</p>

<p>“Molly Trueheart would not care—not a bit!” she
declared, with a half sob. “And—and it’s none of
your business, any way, Mr. Cecil Laurens, and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
think you’re old enough to know better than to meddle
with—anybody—like this. I would have told you all
about it if you hadn’t been so smart, but now I won’t,
so there! And you may go and tell Aunt Thalia all
you know, if you’re mean enough, and of course you
<i>are</i>!”</p>

<p>With that she bounced out of her chair and flew
to the bay-window, where she stood with her back to
him, her cheeks hot with anger, and her eyes so dim
with tears that she could not see how brightly the stars
were sparkling in the sky.</p>

<p>Cecil Laurens remained perfectly silent, and there
was a glitter of anger in his violet eyes.</p>

<p>“What a little fury!” he was thinking. “I have
always heard that the Barrys were high-spirited, but I
never had an exhibition of their temper before. Pity
to spoil such a pretty face flying into such a rage.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Barry’s ten minutes passed without bringing
her back, and Mr. Laurens grew tired of watching
Molly’s obdurate back. He opened the grand organ
and sat down before it, pressing his fingers softly on
the keys.</p>

<p>Music was his one passion, and he had devoted
years to its study. He played now a low <i>andante</i>
movement, full of grace and sweetness and tenderness
that soothed his own perturbed spirit, and made him
momentarily forget the audacious girl who had disturbed
him. Gliding from one melody into another,
he paused, at last, with a sudden remembrance, and,
turning his head, saw Molly close beside him.</p>

<p>The music had drawn her against her will by a
strange, magnetic power. All the anger had died from
her face and eyes, leaving a dreamy softness in its
place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>“So I have soothed your savage spirit?” he exclaimed,
with a smile, and Molly started and blushed.</p>

<p>“I—I—am fond of music,” she stammered.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you will play for me now?” he said, rising.</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” starting back, and just then Mrs. Barry
came in.</p>

<p>“I have been playing to your little girl,” Cecil Laurens
said to her, with a smile.</p>

<p>“She may look like a little girl, but she is a grown-up
young lady, Cecil,” Mrs. Barry answered, quickly,
and Molly cried out, vexedly:</p>

<p>“I am not! I won’t be seventeen till August.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Barry glared at her displeasedly.</p>

<p>“Only hear her, Cecil! pretending to be a school-girl
still! I never <i>could</i> understand why girls try to
make themselves out younger than they really are. I
am sure there is not such a charm in callow youth as
they think,” she said, tartly.</p>

<p>Molly was already biting her lips in dismay.</p>

<p>“Aunt Thalia, I was jesting,” she said, soberly,
without glancing at Cecil Laurens.</p>

<p>She was asking herself if he would betray her to
her aunt, if he would accuse her then and there of that
“lark” which she shuddered to remember now; but
apparently he meant to put it off to some more convenient
season, for presently he said good-night and
went away without alluding to the subject. Molly
drew a sigh of relief as he left, but his blue eyes and
his wondrous music haunted her perturbed dreams
that night.</p>

</div>


<p>Next morning she said to Mrs. Barry:</p>

<p>“Aunt Thalia, I think I should enjoy my visit much
more if I might ride horseback.”</p>

<p>“Can you ride?” looking up from her breakfast of
fried chicken and hot rolls.</p>

<p>“I have been on a horse’s back only once, but I can
easily learn if you will let me have a horse,” Molly
answered, confidently, and a sudden light broke over
Mrs. Barry’s face.</p>

<p>“The very thing,” she exclaimed. “I’m glad you
thought of it. Cecil Laurens shall teach you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no,” Molly cried, in consternation. “I
won’t ride with him. I’ll go alone.”</p>

<p>“But Cecil will be perfectly willing, child, and he is
a splendid equestrian.”</p>

<p>“But I hate him—I mean I don’t like men,” exclaimed
the girl, flushing under Mrs. Barry’s gorgon
stare.</p>

<p>“Louise Barry, you are a goose! I shall never
cease to regret that Lucy Everett had the training of
you. Any other girl would be glad of the chance of
Cecil Lauren’s company. He is the richest and finest
young man in the state.”</p>

<p>“I—don’t—like—young men, auntie.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Barry glowered at her angrily over her glasses.</p>

<p>“Do you like woolly headed, stupid old negro men?”
she snapped.</p>

<p>“Ye-es, aunt,” demurely.</p>

<p>“Very well, then, you shall have the finest horse in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
the stable, and old Abe shall teach you to ride—but I
wonder at your taste,” sneering.</p>

<p>Molly flushed, but finished her breakfast in silence,
and then ran upstairs to arrange an impromptu riding-habit.</p>

<p>By letting out the tucks in her red cashmere dress
she made a very presentable habit, combined with the
velvet-trimmed jacket, and setting a little red-plumed
turban on her mop of curls she ran down-stairs in the
gayest spirits.</p>

<p>“I’m ready, Aunt Thalia.”</p>

<p>“Whew! You’re like a whirlwind, Louise,” exclaimed
Mrs. Barry; but she summoned old Abe at
once, and said:</p>

<p>“Miss Barry wants a ride, Abe, and you must go
with her as she is not accustomed to riding. Saddle
the young gray mare and take her at once.”</p>

<p>“Um-hum, gwine broke her neck now, fo’ sartain
sure,” grumbled the old man, who did not like to be
called from his pipe in the kitchen. But he set off
obediently for the stable, while Molly danced with impatience
awaiting his return.</p>

<p>“May I go into Lewisburg for letters? I am sure
there must be one from my sister,” she said, and the
brow of the old aristocrat gloomed over.</p>

<p>“You may go to the post-office, but—I told you,
Louise, never to call that girl your sister again!”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, Aunt Thalia, my step-sister,”
amended Molly, but she bit her red lips sharply to
keep back indignant words.</p>

<p>“How she despises my mother’s memory and my
mother’s daughter,” she thought bitterly, and it was
well that Uncle Abe came up just then, mounted on a
sturdy old bay horse and leading a handsome gray filly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
by the bridle, or her indignation might have over-flowed
into words. As it was she turned off sharply,
ran down the steps and sprang into the saddle, cantering
off at a pace that startled Uncle Abe.</p>

<p>“Lor’-A’mighty! De gal gwine broke her neck in
ten minutes!” he growled, as he galloped briskly after
her, while Mrs. Barry looking on, thoroughly enjoyed
the girl’s fearless riding.</p>

<p>“She will make a good rider. It is the first thing
in which she has shown herself a Barry,” she muttered,
for this gay little humming-bird of a creature
had rather startled the old lady by her unlikeness to
the Barrys, who as a rule were homely rather than
handsome, and dignified rather than merry.</p>

<p>But on the whole, Mrs. Barry was proud of this
lovely niece. She had all the fondness for beauty that
is inherent in homely people, and it pleased her to gaze
on that beautiful, spirited face, although very girlish-looking
for the twenty-five years with which she was
accredited.</p>

<p>She gazed after the girl with actual pride, and muttered:</p>

<p>“Cecil admired her, I am sure, although he left so
soon! I hope from my heart that it will be a match.
It would please me better than anything else in the
world! How fortunate that he returned just now
when he was least expected. It must have been fate!”</p>

<p>Unconscious of Mrs. Barry’s designs against her
single blessedness, Molly jogged along soberly toward
Lewisburg, having been scolded into sedateness by lazy
old Uncle Abe.</p>

<p>There must have been a fate in it as the old lady
said, for just as their horses came opposite the park<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
gates at Maple Shade, Cecil Laurens rode out on a
magnificent black horse, bowed and smiled, and cantered
to Molly’s side.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Miss Barry, good morning, Uncle
Abe. A bright day,” he said.</p>

<p>Molly bowed with a half defiant air. What evil
sprite had sent this man again across her path?</p>

<p>Yet she gazed as if fascinated in unwilling admiration
at his handsome face which in the clear open light
of day showed at its best. What dark, tender depths
there were to his violet eyes, how regularly handsome
his features, how the sun brought out the rare shade
of his thick mustache and clustering masses of gold-brown
hair. Then his figure, how tall and manly it
was as it sat with martial grace in the saddle.</p>

<p>“I hate him, but—he is rather good-looking,” she
admitted to herself, with reluctant justice.</p>

<p>“Marse Cece,” burst in Uncle Abe, with startling
abruptness, “aine you gwine to de pos’-office, too?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Uncle Abe.”</p>

<p>The artful old negro chuckled audibly:</p>

<p>“How fort’nit, how werry fort’nit,” he observed.
“Now you kin take keer o’ Miss Looisy on her ride, ef
you please, sah, fo’ my hoss done cast his shoe, and I
got to turn off dis road and take him to de black-smiff!”</p>

<p>“Uncle Abe, you are an old story-teller. There is
nothing the matter with the horse. I’ll tell Aunt
Thalia if you don’t come straight along with me!”
threatened Molly in comical distress and anger combined;
but the cunning old fellow was already galloping
off, leaving her to the tender mercies of Cecil Laurens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>“Do not mind him, Miss Barry,” said the young
man. “I will take as good care of you as Uncle Abe.”</p>

<p>She pouted and turned her horse’s head.</p>

<p>“I am going back to Ferndale!”</p>

<p>He caught her reins and held them as he had done
before.</p>

<p>“You are not!” he said, vexedly. “Why, what a
baby you are! Why should you go back and get that
old darky a scolding from Mrs. Barry? The old soul
is only going into Maple Shade to chat with my servants.
He has known me ever since I was a baby, and
feels safe in trusting you to my care. Mrs. Barry is
my godmother, too, so how can you be so unreasonable?
<i>Come.</i>”</p>

<p>“I <i>am</i> acting foolishly,” she thought, and yielded to
that one word of commingled command and entreaty,
telling herself that she was too anxious for a letter to
turn back now.</p>

<p>Cecil Laurens knew well the magnetic power of that
low, winning voice of his. He smiled slightly as she
turned and rode on by his side up the mountain.</p>

<p>“You and I almost had a battle last night,” he went
on. “After I went away I thought it over, and decided
that you—we—had been very silly. It seemed
so strange for a Barry and a Laurens to quarrel.
Why, our families have been neighbors and friends
almost a century,” proudly.</p>

<p>“That is no reason why you should have been so—so
domineering and overbearing to me,” she broke out,
with defiant eyes.</p>

<p>He looked intently at the tall green ferns growing in
the masses of mossy stone by the road-side several
minutes before he replied, quietly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p>“I am sorry. Will you forgive me?”</p>

<p>“If—you—won’t—<i>tell</i> Aunt Thalia,” she replied,
half entreatingly.</p>

<p>The violet orbs turned from contemplating the ferns
to her face. The two pairs of eyes met.</p>

<p>“Did you really think I could tell tales?” he queried,
gravely, and something in those eyes impelled her to
answer:</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I thought you would learn to trust me,” he
said, with that wonderful smile whose sweetness
dazzled Molly’s eyes. “Now let us pledge friendship,
for the sake of—our families.”</p>

<p>She began to smile, her anger melting under his
kindliness.</p>

<p>“I—I—won’t claim your friendship on the score of
our families. If you promise me your friendship, it
must be for what I am worth myself—and if I like
you, it must be for yourself, not because you are a
Laurens,” she replied, with such seriousness and earnestness
that he laughed, and quoted:</p>

<p>you think, Miss Barry. Well, I own I am proud of
my family, but I am willing to take your good-will on
your own terms.”</p>

<p>He held his hand out, and she laid her little gloved
one in it. He pressed her shabby little gauntlet a moment,
gently, and a thrill of pleasure ran along the
girl’s nerves.</p>

<p>“He is so nice—and only last night I hated him!”
she said, naïvely, to herself.</p>

<p>What a ride it was, and how charming she found
her late foe! He praised her riding, and declared that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
it was splendid, considering this was only her second
attempt.</p>

<p>“You must let me ride with you every morning.
You will find me more trustworthy than Uncle Abe,”
he said, and Molly, who had vowed only that morning
that she would have nothing to do with him, agreed
to his wish with frank pleasure.</p>

<p>But the violet eyes and the low, winning voice had
disarmed her resentment. Molly was pleased to find a
friend where she had dreaded an enemy.</p>

<p>“He will not tell Aunt Thalia, and if Louise will
only let me come home before I do any other mischief,
everything will go right,” she thought; then, looking
up, suddenly: “If I get a letter from my sister this
morning, I shall have to go home soon,” she said.</p>

<p>She saw a dark frown come over his face. He exclaimed,
brusquely:</p>

<p>“I hate to hear you call that actress’ daughter sister!”</p>

<p>“Why?” sharply.</p>

<p>“Oh, it was a terrible <i>mésalliance</i>. Your father
ought never to have married that woman, and your
friends should never have allowed you to be raised as
the companion of her child. The gulf between you is
wide, and there is really no relationship, you know,”
he said, proudly.</p>

<p>Molly looked at him strangely without reply. He
was puzzled by her eyes—there was in them such a
sudden look of anguish and pride, with something like
reproach. He could not understand it, and asked himself
if she meant to uphold the cause of that odious
woman.</p>

<p>But here they were at the post-office, and there was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
a letter for Miss Louise Barry. She caught it eagerly
from his hand.</p>

<p>“It is from my sis—my step-sister, and I know she
has written for me to come home!” Molly cried, excitedly.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</h2>
</div>


<p>Molly rode very fast on returning, and she was so
quiet that Cecil Laurens regarded her knit brows and
pursed-up lips in surprise.</p>

<p>“You are leading me a sort of John Gilpin race,
Miss Barry. What is the matter with you?” he said.</p>

<p>“I am impatient to read my letter,” she replied in a
curt voice.</p>

<p>They were outside the limits of the town now, and
riding up the mountain road beneath tall overarching
trees that lined the road on either side. He said,
kindly:</p>

<p>“We can stop long enough to read your letter, since
you are so impatient.”</p>

<p>Molly let the speed of her gray filly slacken a little,
and looked round at him with candid eyes.</p>

<p>“I would rather not,” she said.</p>

<p>“But there would be nothing improper in doing so,
and I am not in a hurry,” he urged.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know; but I’m afraid. If I read the letter,
and sis—I mean, Aunt Lucy—did not say <i>yes</i>, I should
fly into a tantrum and alarm you,” with a sparkle of
malice in the black eyes.</p>

<p>“I think I <i>have</i> seen you in a tantrum,” he replied,
with equal malice. “But of course Aunt Lucy will say
yes to any request of yours.”</p>

<p>She shook her curly head despondingly, but the filly
had fallen unchecked into a slower pace.</p>

<p>“Ah, you don’t <i>know</i>, Mr. Laurens,” she said, dolorously.
“You see, I wrote to Aunt Lucy that I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
tired of Ferndale, and wanted to come home, but—but—I’m
afraid she won’t let me go yet.”</p>

<p>“Tired of Ferndale?” he repeated.</p>

<p>“Yes, sick and tired,” she replied, emphatically. “I
thought it would be jolly fun to come, at first, but I’ve
been here three weeks now, and it’s the pokiest old
hole I ever saw! I’d give anything to be back in
Staunton.”</p>

<p>“She has left a lover behind her, of course,” the
young man thought to himself, and he said, in rather a
cross tone:</p>

<p>“Your aunt would be angry if she heard you
abusing Ferndale like that. Do you know that it is
considered a fine place?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I wouldn’t have Aunt Thalia know my
private opinion of it. You won’t betray me, will
you?” smiling.</p>

<p>“No, but I’m sorry you want to get away from
Ferndale,” with unaccountable inward irritation.
“Why don’t you tell your Aunt Thalia so?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” with a horrified gesture, “not for worlds.
You know—I’m to be her heiress. I must not offend
her, or she may disinherit me.”</p>

<p>“So you are mercenary?” lifting his graceful brows
into distinctive arches.</p>

<p>“It runs in the Barry blood, does it not?” she retorted.</p>

<p>And he answered gravely:</p>

<p>“I never knew it before!”</p>

<p>Molly laughed merrily.</p>

<p>“Now, you make me think you a hateful prig again.
But there, we needn’t quarrel, only I must say again,
I don’t want to stay at Ferndale, and I pray Heaven
this letter may send me permission to go home.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<p>He would have joined her in that fervent prayer if
he had known what that letter was to bring forth, but
in his ignorance and blindness he began to say to himself
that it was a pity old Mrs. Barry was going to
lose her bright young companion so soon.</p>

<p>“But, it <i>is</i> lonely for such a little butterfly,” he
thought. “I must try to brighten up her life at Ferndale
for my old friend’s sake.”</p>

<p>Full of this generous impulse, he said:</p>

<p>“It shall not be dull any more at Ferndale. I know
many of the pretty, lively young girls at Lewisburg,
and I shall bring some of them to call on you. Then
we will devise some parties and picnics to amuse you.
I only wish my mother and sisters were at home so
that you could come and make a visit at Maple
Shade.”</p>

<p>“They would not care about <i>me</i>!” she replied with
an odd touch of bitterness.</p>

<p>“Miss Barry, you ought to know better than that.
Did I not tell you that our families are intimate
friends? My mother and my sisters would take the
greatest interest in you. I wish that Mrs. Barry had
sent you abroad with my sisters to be educated.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” with sarcasm.</p>

<p>He paid no attention to her outburst, but continued,
as if struck by a sudden thought:</p>

<p>“I have an idea.”</p>

<p>“Really?” exclaimed Molly, with deeper sarcasm
than before.</p>

<p>“Yes, impossible as it may appear to you,” he replied,
flushing slightly under the fire of her large, magnetic
dark eyes. “Miss Barry, you know that I have
but lately left London and that I shall return in a few
weeks?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” carelessly.</p>

<p>“Here is my plan, I shall ask Mrs. Barry to let me
take charge of you and place you at school with my
sisters to finish your education.”</p>

<p>Molly caught her breath quickly, and something like
a sharp regret pierced her heart.</p>

<p>To herself she said:</p>

<p>“Ah, if I were not a little fraud what a future
would lie before me!”</p>

<p>But looking up into his face with eyes that gave no
sign of the pang she was enduring, she said:</p>

<p>“Mr. Laurens, you must have taken leave of your
senses to talk about a girl of five-and-twenty finishing
her education.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, Miss Barry, you look much
younger than that, and you certainly do need a little
more polish. The Barrys were always noted for their
polished manners,” he replied, frankly, but the frankness
on the whole was rather engaging.</p>

<p>Molly did not resent the imputation of brusquerie.
She had heard it so often before that it was nothing
new, and besides she was quivering all over with a
tempest of excitement and regret, evoked by his words
of a moment ago.</p>

<p>To go abroad, to cross that big, blue sparkling ocean
had been the passionate desire of her life; oh, what
would she not give to realize that dream!</p>

<p>She had never envied the Barrys before; indeed,
she had openly cherished an amused contempt for
their family pride, and had never sighed for their
broad acres or the blue blood that flowed in their
veins. In this moment of sore temptation, however,
all was reversed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p>“I wish—I wish—I were really Louise Barry instead
of a contemptible little fraud!” she sighed. “But
then how much better is <i>she</i>? It is all a muddle, and
I can’t go, that’s all. And I hope and pray that Lou
has fixed up some plan for me to come home, for
everything is getting tangled up dreadfully!”</p>

<p>Poor child, she thought so truly, for at every step
she was floundering deeper into “the tangled web of
fate.”</p>

<p>They rode in presently across the lawn at Ferndale,
and Mrs. Barry, from her seat in the wide hall, gave a
smirk of satisfaction at sight of Cecil Laurens.</p>

<p>Molly sprang down from her horse without waiting
for assistance, flew up the steps, across the porch and
hall, and upstairs like a little tornado, wild to possess
herself of the contents of that fateful letter.</p>

<p>Cecil Laurens, half-vexed at her unceremonious exit
from the scene, dismounted more leisurely, and, handing
his reins to a negro lad, went in to pay his respects
to his old friend, Mrs. Barry.</p>

<p>“Now, this is kind of you, Cecil; but where did you
pick up Louise?” beaming.</p>

<p>He explained, taking special care not to expose old
Abe’s little artifice, by which he had gained a morning’s
gossip with his darky friends.</p>

<p>“You must spend the day with us,” said the old
lady. “Louise will be down in a minute. She has
only run upstairs to change her dress.”</p>

<p>“And to read her letter,” he added.</p>

<p>“Her letter?”</p>

<p>“She had a letter from home,” he explained, and
Mrs. Barry’s brow gloomed over.</p>

<p>“A letter from that odious relative, the daughter of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
the actress! Oh, how I wish I could break her off
from those pernicious influences!” she sighed.</p>

<p>“Let me suggest a way,” cried Cecil Laurens, with
sparkling eyes.</p>

<p>“So soon?” she thought, triumphantly; but her ardor
was a little dampened when he continued:</p>

<p>“You know I return to Europe in a few weeks. Let
me take your niece with me and place her at school
with my sisters.”</p>

<p>She uttered a little gasp of dismay, and presently
cried out:</p>

<p>“At school—Louise at school! What nonsense,
Cecil! Why, she finished lessons long ago. She is
plenty old enough to be married.”</p>

<p>And a minute’s silence ensued.</p>

<p>There was a lurking smile on Cecil’s faultless face,
and he thought within himself:</p>

<p>“She may be old enough, but she is certainly not
wise enough. I would as soon think of marrying a
baby.”</p>

<p>But feeling himself snubbed, he did not voice these
sentiments aloud. He said, simply:</p>

<p>“I forgot her age. She seems so very young—as
young as my school-girl sisters.”</p>

<p>“She lacks training. Her aunt Lucy has spoiled
her, that is why she seems so childish,” she replied,
apologetically.</p>

<p>“So I thought. That is why I suggested a little
more polish, such as can only be acquired in a first-class
school,” he replied. “But, dear Mrs. Barry,
please do not think me meddlesome. It was a hasty
thought spoken out too freely.”</p>

<p>“My dear Cecil! I am sure I thank you for expressing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
such an interest in Louise. It is very flattering
to her, coming from <i>you</i>,” Mrs. Barry said,
pointedly, and then she took the young man into her
confidence and told him of her wish to keep her niece
at Ferndale, and so separate her from her objectionable
step-sister, “that theater child.”</p>

<p>Cecil Laurens applauded her resolve warmly, although
he felt somewhat like a traitor to the girl who
had so frankly confided to him her honest dislike of
Ferndale.</p>

<p>“Next week I shall take her to the White Sulphur
Springs,” she said. “I mean to give her such a round
of gayety that she will not longer regret her humdrum
home in Staunton.”</p>

<p>And again Cecil Laurens applauded this resolve.
He had as deeply grained a prejudice against “that
theater child” as had old Mrs. Barry herself, and desired
just as ardently to keep Louise at Ferndale.</p>

<p>“I shall go to the White for a week myself just as
soon as I get my business here over,” he said, and Mrs.
Barry replied that she was very glad. It would be
pleasanter for her and Louise having an old friend
there.</p>

<p>But when this confidential conversation was over,
Mrs. Barry began to think that her niece stayed upstairs
a long time. She sent Ginny Ann to call her
down.</p>

<p>Ten, then fifteen minutes elapsed before Ginny Ann
reappeared with the announcement:</p>

<p>“I done argyfied my breff mos’ away, mistis, but I
carn’t budge dat chile! She done laid herseff down
on dat flure, a-cryin’ and a-cryin’ her bressid eyes
out!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</h2>
</div>


<p>Mrs. Barry rose with as much haste as her age and
infirmities would permit, and excusing herself to Cecil
Laurens, went upstairs after her obdurate niece.</p>

<p>The young man, left alone, said to himself:</p>

<p>“Mrs. Everett has proved herself a wise woman and
refused to let her niece leave Ferndale. I applaud
her good sense.”</p>

<p>And he did not alter his opinion even when Molly
came down presently with red-rimmed eyes and a
doleful expression that proved how deeply she had
taken her disappointment to heart.</p>

<p>Mrs. Barry did not come down with her, and she
went out on the wide porch and sat down sulkily in a
big rustic chair.</p>

<p>Cecil Laurens followed her, and leaning his arms
on the top of her chair, looked down into the pretty
clouded face.</p>

<p>“What did Aunt Lucy say?” he asked.</p>

<p>Molly snapped out a vicious little “No!”</p>

<p>“A wise woman,” said Cecil Laurens.</p>

<p>Molly looked up at him with an angry gleam in the
dark eyes.</p>

<p>“Do you think so?” she asked in an odd tone, adding
sharply: “Time will tell.”</p>

<p>Then the bright eyes turned from him and wandered
toward the grove of trees that inclosed the
house. He saw her breast rise and fall quickly, and
her little hands clinched themselves in silent anger.
Plainly, Molly was in a passion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>

<p>“Miss Barry, you puzzle me!” said Cecil Laurens.
“Why are you so anxious to return to Staunton?
Have you a lover there?”</p>

<p>Molly glanced up, and a saucy smile broke through
the gloom of her face.</p>

<p>“Pray, is that any of your business, sir?” she demanded,
pertly, and was amazed when he answered,
promptly:</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“But how?” curiously.</p>

<p>“Forewarned is forearmed. I did not want to fall
in love with you myself if there were any prior claim
on you,” he replied, coolly and teasingly.</p>

<p>“I am not the least afraid you will commit such a
folly,” she replied, carelessly. “If it were my step-sister,
now—but it could never be <i>me</i>!”</p>

<p>“Your step-sister!” with a frown. “That would be
impossible, you know. But tell me why you think so.”</p>

<p>“Oh, she is dignified like the Barrys, and has such
an odd, charming style of beauty—yellow hair and
yellow eyes.”</p>

<p>“Like a tigress,” said Cecil Laurens, and Molly
started.</p>

<p>“I never thought of it before, but she is like <i>that</i>,”
she exclaimed. “She can be so sweet and purring, yet
all the time you seem to feel that she has cruel claws
hidden under her furred paws. She can be so hard,
too—oh, you should see the letter she wrote me!”</p>

<p>“And you think I could fall in love with such a
tiger-cat as you describe. Thank you,” he said, with
frank pique.</p>

<p>“But perhaps you would not <i>feel</i> that the claws
were there as I <i>do</i>,” her large eyes dilating with earnestness.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
“You would see only that odd beauty and
that grand air.”</p>

<p>“Copied from the theater,” he said, and Molly
flushed hotly.</p>

<p>“Well, copied from the stage if you will,” she replied,
curtly. “But all the same you would admire
her, I am sure.”</p>

<p>“I should not,” he replied with decision, and Molly
half laughed, then relapsed into seriousness and wrath
again.</p>

<p>“Oh, how mean she was in that letter today! What
a dig she gave me with her vicious claws! She ought
to have known me better—ought to have been afraid—”
she paused and bit her lips.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” he asked, curiously, and a
light of anger and resentment flashed all over the girlish
face.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” she said. “Never mind, but I mean
to <i>pay her back</i>, that is all, and—no one can blame me
now!”</p>

<p>He was gratified at seeing her mind set against that
odious step-sister.</p>

<p>“Miss Barry, I am glad you have had your eyes
opened to the worthlessness of that girl,” he said,
earnestly. “Her mother was an adventuress who inveigled
your father into a low marriage that alienated
from him all his friends and relatives. It is
most fortunate for you that Mrs. Barry relented after
his death and decided to make you her heiress.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, very fortunate,” said Molly, but it distressed
him to notice that her tone was distinctly sarcastic,
and that she clinched her little fists again as if
in a secret fury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>

<p>“I suppose,” he went on, excitedly, “that the girl is
envious of your good fortune, hence her disagreeable
letter to you.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” agreed Molly.</p>

<p>“Do not let her rancor trouble you. She is beneath
the notice of a Barry. Her spleen is not worth paying
back,” Cecil said.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, it is, and I propose to pay her interest on
the debt,” she replied, angrily, and for the present he
saw that it would be useless to oppose her will. He
decided to humor her whim.</p>

<p>“By all means pay her back then, and perhaps I can
help you with the interest,” he said, lightly.</p>

<p>“Thank you; I was counting on your assistance,”
she replied, with a strange smile, and in a tone of decided
earnest.</p>

<p>The dark eyes met his with a look of triumph he
could not understand.</p>

<p>“What can I do to help you to your vengeance?”
he asked, but she shook her head and made no reply.</p>

</div>


<p>Days came and went, and Cecil Laurens was a daily
visitor at Ferndale, filled with the laudable desire to
please his old friend, Mrs. Barry, by making time pass
pleasantly for her niece. At least, that was the reason
he assigned to himself when he set out every morning
for a canter with Molly over the rough mountain
roads, in the golden June weather.</p>

<p>If any one had told him that he was taking an unusual
interest in the madcap girl whose acquaintance
he had made in such a ludicrous manner, he would
have been indignant at the imputation. He would
have told you, as his family and friends said of him,
that he was not susceptible, not a marrying man. In
his thirty years of life he had met many beautiful and
charming women, had</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Knelt at many a shrine,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Yet laid the heart on none.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>So little had he cared for women that he had not, as
many men have done, created an ideal woman in his
mind; but if he had done so, she would not have resembled
Molly Trueheart in the least; she would have
been full of gracious ease and dignity:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“A perfect creature, nobly planned,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">To warn, to comfort, and command,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And yet a spirit still and bright,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">With something of an angel’s light.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>
<p>Molly Trueheart did not come up to this ideal at all.
She was a merry, willful little maid, reminding one of
April weather with her alternations from frowns to
smiles, and from laughter to tears. Cecil Laurens
never suspected her of a bit of sentiment until one day
when he came upon her unexpectedly, and found her
reading Mrs. Browning with the page open at “Lady
Geraldine’s Courtship.”</p>

<p>“You read poetry, then? I am surprised,” he said.</p>

<p>Molly left her finger between the pages and looked
up at him without a trace of surprise at his sudden
coming. Perhaps she had seen or heard him.</p>

<p>“You are surprised—why? Did you think I could
not read?” she inquired flippantly.</p>

<p>“Certainly not—but poetry! I thought you had no
romance about you—only fun,” he rejoined.</p>

<p>“You were mistaken. I am romantic. If I had not
been I should never have come to Ferndale.”</p>

<p>“I fail to see the romance of your coming here,
Miss Barry.”</p>

<p>“It is not necessary that you should see it,” with a
twinkle of mirth in her eyes.</p>

<p>“No,” he returned, piqued at the brusquerie of the
retort. In a minute he added: “Since you confess to
being romantic, perhaps you will read ‘Lady Geraldine’s
Courtship’ aloud for me. It is just the scene
for reading poetry—this grassy seat, these nodding
ferns, overarching trees, sunshine, and all the rest of
it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will read it for you. That will be better
than hearing you sneer at me,” said Molly.</p>

<p>She let her stony, dark eyes meet his violet ones for
a moment coolly, then dropped her gaze to the book.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
In a minute she began to read with a clear, pure enunciation
and a faultless accuracy that amazed him.
Throwing himself down on the velvety greensward by
her side, he listened like one fascinated to the poet’s
flowing numbers rendered with faultless accuracy by
Molly’s fresh, young voice.</p>

<p>Who does not know the story of “Lady Geraldine’s
Courtship”?—the story of the poor poet’s love for a
lovely, noble lady who trampled under her dainty feet
the prejudices of pride and rank and wedded the
young genius, her lover? Molly’s eloquent voice gave
full value to the story, rose in passion, sank in pathos,
thrilled and trembled alternately, while her eyes
sparkled or melted to tears in sympathy. Cecil Laurens,
the handsome, gifted man of the world, indolent,
self-conceited, proud, gazed and listened in unfeigned
astonishment.</p>

<p>“The little witch has been teasing me all this while.
She is not the little ignoramus and madcap I believed
her at first. She has been well-educated, her voice is
thoroughly trained. No wonder she laughed when I
wanted her to go to school again,” he said to himself,
but instead of being angry with her, he experienced
pleasure in finding out that she had culture he had not
dreamed she possessed.</p>

<p>The long poem came to an end at last and Molly
folded her small hands together over the page. Her
listener started up to a sitting posture.</p>

<p>“Thank you, for the pleasure you have given me,”
he said, earnestly. “It is indeed a grand poem.”</p>

<p>“I scarcely expected you to say so,” she retorted,
meaningly. “I thought you were too proud. How can
you reconcile yourself to the idea of the Lady Geraldine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
marrying so far beneath her in station—you who
are always taking for a text my poor father’s <i>mésalliance</i>?”</p>

<p>“This case was different—the poet’s genius leveled
the barrier between him and the earl’s daughter—raised
him to her rank,” he replied.</p>

<p>“My—step-mother—had genius. She was a star of
the dramatic stage. She gave up a brilliant career to
marry the man she loved, yet you condemn her as unworthy,”
Molly said, excitedly, with flashing eyes.</p>

<p>He frowned.</p>

<p>“Why will you always drag <i>that</i> into the conversation?
You have owned of your own accord that that
woman’s daughter was sly and disagreeable—a real
tiger-cat!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Ah, I see that poetic license is not to be carried
into real life,” she replied, falling from seriousness
into levity. Then, gayly: “And are you sure, quite
sure, that you should not fall in love with golden hair
and golden eyes, and <i>l’air noble</i>?”</p>

<p>“Quite sure,” he replied, with disdain.</p>

<p>She laughed, and there was something hidden in the
laugh that vexed him; but she said, politely enough,
the next moment:</p>

<p>“Now you will read to me, will you not?”</p>

<p>“Pardon me; I would rather talk to you. When
are you going to the White?”</p>

<p>But he had taken the book from her hands, and was
turning the leaves while he spoke. Molly answered,
reluctantly:</p>

<p>“I—don’t know. Aunt Thalia said something about—about
waiting until you got ready.”</p>

<p>“How kind! I shall be delighted. I can go in about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
three days, I should say. But you don’t look very
glad at the thought of my company.”</p>

<p>“I would as soon excuse you,” she replied, with her
usual frankness.</p>

<p>He frowned, but would not answer, and in a minute
began to read aloud, as it seemed, at random:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘She was not as pretty as women I know,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And yet all your best made of sunshine and snow</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Drop to shade, melt to naught in the long-trodden ways,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">While she’s still remembered on warm and cold days,</div>
    <div class="verse indent9">My Kate.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“There,” he said, looking down at her with a half
smile, “those words seem to have been written of you,
you provoking child! Do you know that when I’m
away from you my thoughts always return to you, and
that the hard things you say to me hurt me worse than
when first uttered? I resolve firmly not to go near
you again, but ‘a spirit in my feet’ brings me back to
Ferndale the next day. What have you done to me,
Miss Willy Whisk, as old Betsy calls you, to make
me your abject slave? I certainly,” laughing, “do not
approve of you, so I can not have lost my heart to
you.”</p>

<p>“Heaven forbid!” Molly Trueheart exclaimed, starting
to her feet in such dismay that he said, hastily:</p>

<p>“Pray do not be alarmed. You could not suppose I
really meant it!”</p>

<p>“Of course not. It would be the worst possible
taste,” she returned sarcastically, and Cecil Laurens,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
angered out of his usual good breeding, cried out,
sharply:</p>

<p>“I agree with you, Miss Barry!”</p>

<p>That was enough. Molly’s eyes blazed upon him in
such wrath that they almost withered him. She
snatched her book rudely from his hand, and stalked
away with the pace of a tragedy queen.</p>

<p>Left alone thus suddenly under the big tree, Mr.
Laurens watched Molly’s white garments flutter into
the big porch, then he muttered something under his
breath not very complimentary to his tormentor, remounted
his horse, which was waiting under a tree,
and rode home.</p>

<p>The next day he stayed away from Ferndale, and
the next day he sent his old friend a short note saying
that he had been so busy he had no time to call, and
found that unexpected business would take him into
Lewisburg for several days. He hoped she would
not wait for him any longer, as it might not be possible
for him to go to the White at all.</p>

<p>With a very sober face Mrs. Barry read this aloud
to her niece, watching the guilty young face with
covert eyes.</p>

<p>“Louise Barry, you have done something to Cecil,”
she said, with conviction.</p>

<p>But Molly protested loudly that she hadn’t said a
word to Mr. Laurens. Then she went off to one of
her wildest haunts by a secluded little mountain
stream and flung herself down on the green bank to
rest and think.</p>

<p>She caught a glimpse of her pale face and heavy
eyes in the clear stream, and started in surprise.</p>

<p>“Molly Trueheart, is that you looking so pale and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
big-eyed? What is the matter with you, silly? It is
the best thing that ever happened. You ought to
thank your lucky stars that you got rid of him so soon,
the hateful wretch!”</p>

<p>And then very inconsistently she burst into a storm
of angry tears.</p>

</div>


<p>Mrs. Barry and her niece had been at the White two
weeks, when Cecil Laurens made his appearance quite
unexpectedly one evening, and explained to Mrs.
Barry that as he was going away soon he had come
over to bid her good-bye.</p>

<p>To Molly he was very stiff and formal indeed, although
he could almost have sworn that a sudden light
of joy leaped into her eyes at his abrupt approach—a
light instantly veiled beneath the fringe of her dark
lashes, and her voice was distinctly careless as she
gave him a brief greeting and went away from her
aunt’s side with her partner in the dance.</p>

<p>For Molly had become in the weeks of her sojourn
here one of the belles of the place, and was enjoying
her prestige with all the ardor of youth and a light
heart. No one was more sought in the dance than
she, no one had more bouquets and invitations, and
she would not have owned to herself that pique lay
at the bottom of her gayety.</p>

<p>Her girlish pride had been cruelly wounded by
Cecil Laurens’ sarcastic words, and a strange longing
came over her to know if they were really true.</p>

<p>“Would it indeed be such poor taste for any one to
love <i>me</i>?” she asked herself, soberly; and the gravity
of the thought turned the child into a woman.</p>

<p>She threw aside the carelessness that had distinguished
her, and put on what she called grown-up
ways. As she had a good education, and a high order<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
of intellect, she succeeded in making the change very
striking and charming, and in less than two weeks
disproved the truth of the ungallant Cecil’s assertion.</p>

<p>On his part, he was astonished when, after two
weeks of sulky exile, he saw her again, the cynosure
of all eyes at this famous resort of fashion, bright,
beautiful, and admired, as he had not believed it possible
for any one to admire the will-o’-the-wisp creature,
as she had always seemed to him, even while she drew
him to her side by a charm which he would not understand.</p>

<p>“But she is beautiful, certainly, and very brilliant
here—most unlike the forlorn creature that Hero
threw over his head that night at my feet,” he said
to himself with a smile, followed by a frown—the
smile for the ludicrousness of the adventure, and the
frown for the secret that lay behind that night’s
“lark,” as she called it—the escapade so carefully hidden
from her aunt.</p>

<p>“I had no right to keep it hidden from my old
friend. I wish I had not promised to do so,” he
thought, vexed at the sight of Molly gliding like a
fairy down the long ball-room in the arms of as handsome
a partner as ever made maiden’s heart throb
faster in the gay waltz.</p>

<p>Mrs. Barry saw his eyes following the light form,
and said with a touch of pride:</p>

<p>“Louise is a graceful waltzer?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered, then a little testily: “But I do
not approve of indiscriminate waltzing for young
ladies.”</p>

<p>“No?” said Mrs. Barry, turning her inquisitive
glasses on his rather moody face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span></p>

<p>After a minute’s study of its grave lines, she added:</p>

<p>“I can not say that I think it matters except in the
case of engaged girls. Of course a betrothed lover
would have a right to object, but then you know
Louise is free.”</p>

<p>Did he fancy it, or was there really a pointed significance
in her tone? He rejoined half-resentfully:</p>

<p>“Are you sure she is free, and that she did not
leave a lover behind her in Staunton?”</p>

<p>She started, and looked at him keenly, then she
laughed:</p>

<p>“Cecil, you actually frightened me for a moment;
but now you make me laugh,” she said, gayly, with a
laugh that would have been merry, only that it was so
cracked with age. “My dear boy, there is no lover in
Staunton in the case. The child never thought of a
lover until she saw you. But she has offended you. I
believed it all the while, now I am sure of it. You
are jealous.”</p>

<p>“You are mistaken,” Cecil cried, furiously.</p>

<p>Then he shut his lips tightly. He did not like to
contradict his old friend, but it was ridiculous, this
fancy she entertained. Jealous! He would have to
be in love first, and the idea of loving Louise Barry
was—absurd.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is absurd! A spoiled baby in spite of her
twenty-five years, with the audacious frankness of
youth so freely indulged that it degenerates into lack
of manners. Mrs. Barry must be losing her mind, indeed!”
he exclaimed to himself, deciding that he would
certainly go in the morning.</p>

<p>But he did not do so. Something held him back,
something kept him always in the vicinity of the girl<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
he fancied he disliked more than ever now, for she
seemed bent on keeping up their feud. She was so
cool, so reserved, so dignified, taking as she said to
herself grimly “a leaf out of his own book.” So apparently
indifferent was she that many times when he
lingered near her she remained in ignorance of his
proximity, so that day when she thought herself alone
for a minute with a charming novel, Cecil was quite
close to her swinging in a luxurious hammock hung between
two trees, his lazy, sleepy glance resting on the
lovely, spirited face as it bent over the book.</p>

<p>“Poor Madelon!” she sighed, referring to the heroine,
and then there came a sudden interruption.</p>

<p>A man had come straight across the greensward
toward her—a young man with a grave, sad face,
handsome but rather weak, while his attire, partaking
wholly of the shabby genteel, proclaimed that he was
certainly not a favorite of fortune.</p>

<p>Cecil Laurens saw this man going toward Molly
with a bright, eager light in his eyes, and he was filled
with indignant wonder.</p>

<p>“Does Miss Barry know that shabby man? Surely
not,” he thought, and leaned forward to watch with
jealous eyes.</p>

<p>Molly was so intent on her reading that she heard
and saw nothing until a shadow fell on her book as
the man stopped by her side. She glanced up, and the
face that Cecil was watching grew radiant with surprise
and pleasure.</p>

<p>“Johnny!” she exclaimed, and held out her little
hand.</p>

<p>He took it, clasped it tightly a moment, and Cecil
heard him murmur, hoarsely:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span></p>

<p>“How good you are! You never fail one! But I
had no right to expect a welcome. It is the old story—no
work yet, and no money to make a home for my
darling! But I heard you all were here, and I could
not keep from coming for just one sight of my cruel
darling’s face, although I feared her reproaches.
Where is—”</p>

<p>“Hush-h-h!” Molly whispered, pinching his arm
severely; “some one may hear us from the cottage
yonder. Come this way, Johnny, toward the trees.”</p>

<p>They moved away, and Cecil Laurens’ face grew
dark and gloomy.</p>

<p>“The impecunious lover has come upon the scene!”
he muttered, with angry sarcasm.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
</div>


<p>Molly Trueheart walked under the trees with that
mysterious “Johnny” for a long half hour. While
Cecil Laurens in the hammock raved and fretted
against the little fraud, as he began to call her in his
thoughts.</p>

<p>“Suppose I go and bring her aunt upon the scene?”
he thought, with grim resentment.</p>

<p>Then he mentally shook himself.</p>

<p>“Cecil Laurens, you ought to be ashamed of yourself!
Where is your honor that you can be led away
like this by petty spite? Let the girl alone. This is
no business of yours!”</p>

<p>A few minutes later Molly and her good-looking,
shabby companion came back to the rustic seat, still
unobservant of the hammock and its occupant. By
leaning forward a little he could look into both faces,
and he noticed that Molly’s was pale and annoyed,
the man’s eager and excited.</p>

<p>“You must not come here again,” he heard her say.
“It would not be safe. And you must not go after
<i>her</i>. She would be furious if you interfered with her
plans. Better keep quiet for awhile. I will help you
all I can, Johnny,” with a sob, “but you know how
little I can do.”</p>

<p>“You are an angel,” said the man, tenderly. “If
she were only you, there would be no trouble. My
dear, you’ll write to me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, only do keep quiet and not go after <i>her</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
or you’ll spoil everything! I’ll write to you at the old
address! Johnny, I’m sorry for you from my heart,
but I’m under her thumb as well as you. We must
both have patience. Good-bye, now, some one will be
coming.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye, dear,” said the man, sadly, and Cecil
saw him clasp her little rosy fingers tightly in his
broad palm. “God bless you, little one. I shall look
for a letter soon. Write me everything about <i>her</i>,
and I’ll <i>try</i> to stay away, hard as it seems!”</p>

<p>He sighed and turned away, going straight across
the lawn to the broad gates that led to the railroad.
There was something pathetic in his worn, shabby
garments and slow, dejected pace in that scene of
wealth and gayety, and Cecil would have been touched
only for that fierce pain tugging at his heart. But he
turned his eyes away from the man back to Molly,
who had dropped down on her seat and was gazing
after him with sad, wet eyes. He heard her murmur
passionately, “It is a shame!” then she dropped her
face in her hands and sobs shook her slender form.</p>

<p>Cecil had seen Molly in many moods, but here was
a new one, and it excited in him a strange feeling, that
of pity mixed with a bitter resentment, as if he had
suffered some personal wrong at her hands. After a
minute, and still watching the sobbing girl, he began
to analyze his emotions, and as a result the color flew
hotly to his face and he muttered:</p>

<p>“I have actually taken an undue and sentimental
interest in this girl—pshaw, why mince matters?
Through some unexplainable madness I have lost my
heart to a madcap, and am suffering all the torments
of jealousy because another man has a claim on her.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
Mrs. Barry was wiser than I thought, and is no doubt
laughing in her sleeve this moment at my folly.”</p>

<p>The flush deepened on his face, and he remained
for some moments watching Molly in moody silence.</p>

<p>It was a dangerous occupation for a man who had
just found out that she was fatally fair, for Molly, as
she crouched in a forlorn and drooping position on the
hard bench, was a very tempting little specimen of
femininity.</p>

<p>The day was warm and she wore a dress of thin
white mull, through whose transparent texture her
plump arms and shoulders gleamed rosy-white. Her
hat had fallen off, and the loose dark curls half confined
by a scarlet ribbon, drooped against the graceful
neck, and contrasted with the warm pink of a round
cheek nestled in a dainty hand. On this picture of
beauty in distress fell pretty flecks of sunlight from
between the green boughs overhead, bringing out
glints of brightness from the wavy curls, that in the
shade always looked so dark and rich, and Cecil remembered
that there were golden lights in her eyes,
too, when she was pleased and happy.</p>

<p>Then he caught himself up again with a jerk.</p>

<p>“Happy! How can she ever be happy again with
that tramp of a lover on her mind?” angrily.</p>

<p>Something—he scarce knew what, but most probably
that sullen misery that was so new, so bitter, and
so humiliating—drove him to her side. Slipping noiselessly
from the luxurious hammock he stole around
the tree and sat down by her side, touching the bowed
head lightly with his hand, and murmuring with uncontrollable
fondness:</p>

<p>“Louise!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p>Molly gave a great, frightened start and whirled
around.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s you, Cecil Laurens, is it? Well, then, what
do you want?” she demanded, wrathfully, angered because
he had caught her in distress.</p>

<p>For once he was not angered at her sharp retort.
He comprehended now something of what she was
enduring, and made patient allowance for her pain.</p>

<p>“Do not be angry, Louise. I want nothing only
to tell you how sorry I am for you, and how gladly
I would help you in your trouble,” he said so gently
that she stared at him in amazement, although she said
brusquely:</p>

<p>“Trouble! I have no trouble!”</p>

<p>“Ah, Louise, you can not deceive me any longer.
Look yonder! I was in that hammock just now and
saw your companion, also heard some of his words!”</p>

<p>“Spy!” she exclaimed indignantly, although she
grew pale and trembled like the leaves on the tree
above her head.</p>

<p>Again he put a stern guard on himself, and would
not resent her rudeness.</p>

<p>“It is despair that makes her hard!” he thought,
and answered gently:</p>

<p>“I did not mean to be a spy, Louise, I was in the
hammock when you came here, and presently <i>he</i> came
and spoke to you. I could not help hearing what was
said until you walked away with him. But—do not
look so frightened—I did not follow you!”</p>

<p>He saw a gleam of palpable relief flash into the
white face, and comprehended that she was glad he
had not heard what was spoken in that walk under
the trees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>“But <i>I had heard enough</i>!” he said slowly, after a
pause. “Ah, Louise, I was right when I told you that
it was a lover who was drawing your heart back to
your old home.”</p>

<p>She looked at him pale and startled, but with mute
defiance.</p>

<p>“A—a—lover!” she echoed, wildly. “Now I suppose
you will go and tell Aunt Thalia of your wonderful
discovery!” in a tone of terrified entreaty.</p>

<p>“Why will you wrong me so?” he cried, smarting
under the lash of her injustice. “You know I did
not betray you before?”</p>

<p>“But—but—why do you meddle with me so?” she
cried, with a bewildered air. “You are always finding
out things—and—and always blaming me!”</p>

<p>“No, no, child, I do not always blame you, I do not
want to meddle—yet I—yet you—seem so ignorant,
I ought to—to advise you. Will you listen to me
kindly, Louise?”</p>

<p>“Go on,” she answered, folding her hands in her
lap and looking so like a martyr that he cried out
hastily:</p>

<p>“Do not look as if a big bear was going to eat you,
Louise. I only want to tell you that it is not right
to have secrets from your good aunt—to have a
shabby lover whom you write to and meet by stealth.
No good will come of such a clandestine affair.”</p>

<p>“Heaven give me patience!” cried Molly indignantly.
“Poor Johnny, to think of this rich man calling
you shabby! But, Mr. Laurens, that was no meeting
by stealth just now. If you heard his first words
you must know that it was not an appointment.”</p>

<p>“No, he came because he had heard you were here—that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
was the difference,” dryly. “But the first time
I met you, you know—when Hero flung you over his
head at my feet—perhaps you met him that night, perhaps—”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you are a great simpleton, Cecil Laurens!”
Molly cried, indignantly. “I did not meet him that
night, nor any night. Morover, he is no lover of mine.
I never had a lover in my life!”</p>

<p>“You have one now!” Cecil Laurens said softly,
but Molly did not comprehend.</p>

<p>“I have not!” she declared angrily. “Poor Johnny
came here because he thought that my step-sister was
here. They have been engaged two years, and he
can not get a salary large enough to support them,
and Lou—I mean my sister Molly,” crimsoning, “is
angry and wants to break it off. And I promised to
beg her to make it up with the poor fellow, and to
write to him, so there!”</p>

<p>“That step-sister again! It is the first time I ever
was glad to hear her name!” exclaimed Cecil, radiant.
“Oh, Louise, how glad I am that he was her lover and
not yours!”</p>

<p>“What have you got to do with it any way?” she
demanded pettishly.</p>

<p>“I love you!” he replied, audaciously.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
</div>


<p>The black eyes and the blue ones met for an instant,
Cecil’s full of passion, Molly’s full of incredulous
amazement, but her lover did not wait for her to
utter a protest, he caught her little hands in both his
own—and said eagerly:</p>

<p>“Louise, darling, I owe you an apology for the unjust
words I said to you that day at Ferndale. They
were not true, for I love you as I hinted to you then,
and it was pique at your rejoinder that made me blurt
out those untruthful words. Will you forgive me, and
let me love you?”</p>

<p>He had never spoken such words to any woman
before, but carried away by the strength of his newly
discovered passion, they rushed from his lips eloquent
with the heart’s emotion. He had a right to expect
a serious reply, but to his horror, mortification, and
distress, Molly blurted out a curt:</p>

<p>“Nonsense!”</p>

<p>Her elegant lover gave a gasp as if some one had
thrown cold water over him, and a momentary anger
struggled with the delicious emotion of love. He lifted
his violet eyes to her face full of reproachful tenderness.</p>

<p>“Louise!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>She hung her pretty head in bashful confusion.</p>

<p>“You did not mean it!” she muttered, deprecatingly.</p>

<p>“I did mean it. I do mean it. Do not coquette
with me, Louise, when I am so much in earnest. You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
said just now you never had a lover. You have one
now—will you reject him, or will you accept the
heart he offers? Will you be my wife, little one?”</p>

<p>He felt her trembling as he held her hands tightly
in his, and dropping one, he placed his hand beneath
her chin and lifted her face so that he might look
into her eyes. To his surprise and joy they drooped
bashfully, and the warm color rose over her face.</p>

<p>“Louise, what are you going to say to me in return
for my confession? Won’t you love me a little
in return? Won’t you give me some hope?”</p>

<p>Was this Cecil Laurens, the cold, the proud, the
dignified, pleading to the girl he had disapproved
of, the girl he had called such a baby? She looked
at him in wonder and consternation.</p>

<p>“Oh, what have I done?” she cried out in dismay.</p>

<p>“You have bewitched me, I think,” her lover replied
with his rarely beautiful smile.</p>

<p>“Mr. Laurens, do you really mean it? I—I believed
you disliked me, hated me,” she breathed in a low,
half-tender tone, very different from her usual mocking
one.</p>

<p>“I mean it all, Louise. I love you passionately,
and I have suffered torments in the last three weeks
from pique and jealousy that I mistook for anger.
Now, my dear, I have been very frank with you.
Will you be as candid in return?” asked Cecil
Laurens in a low, winning tone, and with a glorious
smile. Certainly although he had learned his love
so suddenly, he knew how to play the lover well.</p>

<p>She trembled and drew back from him as he
leaned toward her. All the sweet vivid color faded
from her face, and her dark eyes sought the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>

<p>“I believe you now, Mr. Laurens, although at first
I thought you were jesting,” she said, and her voice
was distinctly tremulous. “I—I—yes, I will be candid
with you. I am—am—sorry—you—care for me—for—it—is—useless,
hopeless!”</p>

<p>“Hopeless, Louise? Are you sure?” he asked. “If
you have no other lover, let me try to win you. Your
heart is free?”</p>

<p>“No, no, for I love some one else,” she said, desperately.</p>

<p>He was very clever, this Cecil Laurens, and at
that moment he read the heart of the simple girl as
he had read his own as by a flash of light. Smilingly,
and with a man’s masterful air, he returned:</p>

<p>“It is my turn now to cry out nonsense, my darling,
for I do not believe that my love is hopeless. I
saw in your sweet, shy eyes just now a tenderness
that belonged not to ‘some one else,’ but to me.
Look up, Louise, and own that in these weeks while
we seemed to be playing at cross purposes we were
falling headlong into love!”</p>

<p>She tried to deny it, but the usually pert little
tongue faltered under his quizzical and tender gaze.</p>

<p>“Let me alone!” she began frantically, but Cecil
Laurens’ arms had slipped around her waist and he
smothered the remonstrating words on her lips with
a long, sweet, lingering, lover’s kiss—one that seemed
to draw the girl’s pure soul from her body and merge
it into his.</p>

<p>Faint with the sweetness of this exquisite emotion,
Molly rested passive in his clasp for a moment, then
drawing back from him, sighed bitterly.</p>

<p>“Oh, this is dreadful! Why did I ever come to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
Ferndale?” she exclaimed to herself, while Cecil
Laurens’ eyes glowed upon her full of passionate
love. Under their warmth, the girl hung her head
bashfully, all her usual effrontery conquered by the
thrilling consciousness of her love and the bitter pain
she suffered in her secret knowledge of its folly.</p>

<p>“Ah, if he but <i>knew</i>!” she thought with an inward
shudder, and looking up at him with eyes full of
pain, she said:</p>

<p>“I did not try to make you love me, you must always
remember that!”</p>

<p>He laughed as he answered:</p>

<p>“No, you did not court my love, dear, certainly.
I never saw a rose so full of thorns as this one that
I have won.”</p>

<p>“You have not won me!” she cried with a frightened
start, but the triumphant lover, sure of his
prize, replied:</p>

<p>“I do not think you will deny that your heart is
mine, Louise, although I no more tried to win your
love than you did mine. But this being so, the fact
remains we were mutually strongly attracted to each
other, so we must charge our union to the score of
fate.”</p>

<p>“A strange fate!” Molly muttered, but her lover,
who saw nothing but perfection now, where a short
while ago he found so much fault, answered fondly:</p>

<p>“A very beneficent fate. Only think, we shall not
only make ourselves happy by our marriage, but we
shall please our families, who have been neighbors
and intimates almost a century.”</p>

<p>“I have not said I would marry you, Mr. Laurens!”
she cried out, quickly, more and more frightened,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
but he only smiled at what seemed to him
maidenly bashfulness.</p>

<p>“Marriage naturally follows love like ours, dear,”
he said, tenderly. “And, Louise, darling, I shall
make you a very good husband. You will not find
me such a bear as I have been these past weeks,
when your coldness hurt my unconscious love and
stung me to anger. You will be different, too, my
pet, for our love will change our thoughts and our
lives.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she murmured, faintly, for she knew far
better than he the extent of that change, but just
now she did not contradict him again.</p>

<p>“What is the use? He will not listen,” she
thought, feverishly. “I will let him love me while he
is here and when he is gone I will write him very
positively that I can not marry him.”</p>

<p>Her love and his happy masterful air made a
coward of her, and she was willing to put off the
fatal declaration, feeling a guilty pleasure in basking
in this sunshine to which she had no right, and from
which she must soon steal away into the gloom of a
life made sad by an unhappy love.</p>

<p>For deep down in her heart Molly Trueheart knew
already that this mutual love between her and Cecil
Laurens was a catastrophe, not a blessing, as he
believed it. She knew that she could never marry
him, but her feeble declarations to that effect had
been silenced by his objections, so she decided to
filch from fate a few bitter-sweet hours before she
parted forever from this splendid yet forbidden love.</p>

<p>Afterward, when the storm-rains of despair beat
on her defenseless head, and her heart ached on amid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
fiercest tortures, Molly looked back on this hour, the
beginning of it all, with a great wonder at her weakness
and cowardice. Why had she yielded even for
an hour to this madness? Why had she let her love
make her a craven and a coward?</p>

<p>She laid all the blame upon herself in wonder and
sorrow and repentance, too ignorant and unversed in
the mysteries of life and nature to comprehend that
it was not so much her honesty that had been at
fault as that through her love her will-power had
been dominated by the magnetic force of her lover.
For grand, handsome, noble Cecil Laurens, although
unconscious of his power, was possessed of a strong
magnetism that subtly influenced all with whom he
came in contact, and doubly attracted the susceptible
girl whom he loved. She did not realize the power
of this magnetic will any more than Cecil himself
did, yet certainly it was more than half to blame for
poor Molly Trueheart’s treachery.</p>

</div>


<p>All in a minute, as it seemed, he was putting on
her first finger the splendid solitaire diamond from
his own hand.</p>

<p>“Will you wear this for an engagement ring, or
shall I buy you a new one?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I prefer this because you have worn it,” she answered,
frankly, and blushing very much, at which
Cecil was delighted.</p>

<p>To herself she said, sadly:</p>

<p>“That is the truth, but there is another reason still
for my preference. I must not put him to the expense
of a new ring, for this will do for the few days
that I shall be able to keep up the farce of an engagement.”</p>

<p>She sat silent, twisting the costly gem uneasily
about her finger, when suddenly she saw coming
toward her across the lawn Mrs. Barry, attended by
Agnes Walker, her maid.</p>

<p>The sight roused Molly from the dream of bliss
into which she was falling. She pulled the ring from
her finger.</p>

<p>“Here, take it back; I—I can’t marry you. Don’t
tell Aunt Thalia, please,” she faltered, desperately.</p>

<p>Cecil took the ring and her hand with it, and
pushed the jewel back on the slim, rosy finger.</p>

<p>“My darling, what a bashful little goose you are!”
he returned, laughingly; and just then Mrs. Barry
came up and found him holding the little hand
tightly in his own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span></p>

<p>“Louise, I was so uneasy about your long absence,
I took Agnes and came to hunt you; but if I had
known that Cecil was with you, I should not have
been alarmed,” she said.</p>

<p>Molly muttered something incoherently, and tried
to wrest her hand from its captor, but Cecil held it
up triumphantly before Mrs. Barry, who laughed in
glee as she caught the glitter of the diamond.</p>

<p>“Engaged!” she exclaimed, gladly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied, jubilantly. “Will you give us
your blessing, Aunt Thalia?”</p>

<p>“With all my heart,” replied the old woman.
“Louise, do not look so bashful and frightened, my
dear, for I am very much pleased at your choice;”
and she actually kissed the little bit of white forehead
that was visible above the arm with which
Molly had hidden her face.</p>

<p>Agnes Walker, too, looked very proud and pleased,
and uttered a few words of congratulation that
would have delighted Molly if this had not been, as
she said to herself, “all a dreadful sham.”</p>

<p>She sat like one in a dream, listening to Mrs.
Barry’s cracked voice in its complacent chatter.</p>

<p>“Of course you will not go abroad so soon now,
Cecil?”</p>

<p>“I am afraid I ought to go. Mother and father
will expect me, and I promised to go as soon as I
had attended to that business. But—it will be hard
to go now. I have a bright idea. Can not you and
Louise go with me?”</p>

<p>Molly’s heart leaped wildly, then calmed again as
Mrs. Barry shook her head.</p>

<p>“I am too old to cross the sea again. I want to
die in my native land,” she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span></p>

<p>“Louise, then—with a maid, of course?” he said,
but again the old woman shook her head.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it would not be exactly proper then,”
she replied.</p>

<p>“Then I shall write to my folks that I shall delay
my return until my bride is ready to accompany me,”
he replied, with a tender smile at Molly, who replied,
in a fright:</p>

<p>“No, no, I’m too young yet.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” said Mrs. Barry, sharply. “Why,
Louise Barry, in <i>my</i> young days a girl of five-and-twenty
was considered an old maid, and here you
are talking of being too young. Don’t mind her,
Cecil. I’ll order her wedding things at once, and she
shall be ready as soon as you wish.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mrs. Barry!” exclaimed the prospective
bridegroom, radiant.</p>

<p>But Molly muttered, frantically:</p>

<p>“I know Aunt Lucy will not be willing!”</p>

<p>“Lucy Everett has nothing to do with it. I shall not
ask her advice, nor Cecil her consent. If you love
Cecil, there is no more to do but to marry him and
settle down,” proclaimed Mrs. Barry with the air of
an autocrat, and she added, after a minute, sharply:
“I don’t think I shall even invite Lucy Everett to the
wedding, for she would want to bring that Trueheart
girl, and <i>she</i> shall never with <i>my</i> consent cross the
threshold of a Barry!”</p>

<p>“As for the wedding things, don’t they order them
always from Paris? Then, what more will Louise
need but a traveling-dress, since we will go straight
to Europe on our wedding-tour. She can get all the
dresses she wants, then,” said Cecil Laurens, eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span></p>

<p>“That is true,” said the old lady, adding slyly:
“What a hurry you are in all at once, Cecil!”</p>

<p>He flushed and laughed, then said, with a fond
glance at Molly:</p>

<p>“I am in a hurry for my happiness; but then you
know, Mrs. Barry, I have been a spoiled boy always,
and never had patience enough to wait for anything
I wanted!”</p>

<p>“You never <i>had</i> to wait, being one of Fortune’s
favorites, always!” she replied, indulgently.</p>

<p>And Molly thought, with a hushed sigh:</p>

<p>“He will hate me one day, because he will meet his
first disappointment through me!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Barry believed in taking time by the forelock,
and, unknown to the young <i>fiancé</i>, she sent an order
that very day to New York—an order for a <i>recherché</i>
wedding-dress, a traveling costume in all its details,
several dresses besides, comprising walking,
dinner, and ball dresses, hats and bonnets <i>ad. lib.</i>,
and a dozen outfits of embroidered lawn and linen
underwear. These articles were to be furnished within
three weeks.</p>

<p>“They will be as much as she will need until she
gets to Paris. I will give her a large check to take
with her for a <i>trousseau</i> there. I can afford to be
generous as all my money will go to her some day,
and as she is marrying so well,” said the old lady
to Agnes Walker, feeling very complacent over the
happy turn events had taken. She was very fond of
the bride-elect from that time forward, and often
thought remorsefully of the time when she had
locked the girl into the garret.</p>

<p>Cecil Laurens was greatly altered, too, for the better,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
by his love. He ceased to see a single fault in
the gay, young girl whom he had at first condemned.
He lavished the whole wealth of his heart upon her,
and he could not fail to see through all her shyness
that his love was fully returned.</p>

<p>Molly had not known herself capable of such
depths of passion as her lover’s devotion roused in
her breast. She gave herself up with feverish delight
to the happiness of the flying weeks, salving her
conscience with the thought that her deception would
soon be over—that at the very last she would break
off with him even though he would go away from
her hating her memory forever.</p>

<p>But day by day the bonds of love grew stronger.
That which she thought but a garland of roses
strengthened into a chain that held her fast. A mad
love made the brave, honest little girl a traitor.</p>

<p>The day that had been set for her marriage
dawned, yet she had never spoken the words that
were to save Cecil Laurens from wedding a deceiver.</p>

<p>“For I could not break it off without telling him
the truth, and <i>that</i> would ruin Louise. And how
could I part with <i>him</i> now?” she would sigh to herself
when alone, and gradually her love and his made
a bond that she could not break through.</p>

<p>“I should die if I were parted from him now,” she
sighed. “Of course I know that he would find me
out some day, and then I should lose him forever.
But I should have a little happiness first. It would
not be so terrible to die of grief, having had my day
first.”</p>

<p>Then Molly would sob bitterly until she fell asleep
upon her tearwet pillow. Truly the love to which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
she clung so desperately was not all unalloyed pleasure,
but perhaps its element of uncertainty made it
all the more precious.</p>

<p>They went back to Ferndale, and Mrs. Barry, in
the seventh heaven of delight, made preparations on
a grand scale for a real old-fashioned country wedding.
Invitations were sent out far and near to the
friends of the family. A dozen cooks took possession
of the kitchen and dining-room. Flowers were
ordered from a New York florist. The old lady declared
that her niece’s wedding should be the grandest
that ever took place in Greenbrier County.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It was. A hundred guests danced at Molly Trueheart’s
wedding with Cecil Laurens. Ferndale did
not look like the “poky old hole” she had called it
two months ago. By the aid of lights and flowers
and music it was temporarily transformed into fairy-land.
The trees were illuminated by picturesque
Chinese lanterns. The old house in every corner was
as bright as day, and the light glowed resplendently
on the trailing lengths of Molly’s white satin bridal-dress
as she came down the wide stairway almost an
hour later than the time appointed, for at the very
last her conscience had stung her so cruelly that she
had hidden herself in a closet, from which she was
dragged forth after vigilant search by her almost
distracted aunt.</p>

<p>“Louise Barry, what do you mean by such a
caper? You’ve given me such a fright as I never
had in my life! I’ve a mind to give you a good
shaking!” she vociferated, excitedly, and Molly
whimpered, faintly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span></p>

<p>“Please forgive me, Aunt Thalia. I—I was so
frightened, I thought I’d rather not—”</p>

<p>“Rather not <i>what</i>?” sharply.</p>

<p>“Not—get—married,” sighed the delinquent, and
Mrs. Barry burst out laughing.</p>

<p>“What under the heavens makes girls so silly
when they are going to be married?” she cried, and
just then one of the bridesmaids tapped at the door.</p>

<p>“Is the bride ready yet? It’s almost an hour past
the time, and Mr. Laurens sent me to ask—” she
began, but Mrs. Barry cut the sentence short by
opening wide the door.</p>

<p>“She’s ready. Tell the bridesmaids to come in,”
she said; and then she whispered in Molly’s ear:
“Behave yourself like a little lady now, and I’ll never
tell Cecil that you were such a baby as to hide in
the closet because you were afraid to have a husband.”</p>

<p>“I’ll behave,” Molly answered, desperately; and so
well did she keep her promise that Mrs. Barry had
no occasion to tell her husband of that hour in which
Molly’s good angel had been pleading for the right.</p>

</div>


<p>Cecil was waiting at the foot of the stairs, so
eager, so happy, so grand looking in his wedding
garments, that all her regrets vanished in passionate
love and admiration. She clung to his arm, sighing
to herself:</p>

<p>“Oh, Heaven grant that he may never, never find
me out!”</p>

<p>Five minutes more and the ring was on her finger,
the marriage vows had passed her lips, and Cecil
Laurens’ lips had called her wife. She stood in the
middle of the room, pale, but with a quiet dignity, receiving
the congratulations of the guests.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a stir and bustle at the door
where the servants were congregated, looking on at
the brilliant scene. A shabby young man, ghastly
pale, with eyes of fire blazing out of his weak, good-looking
face, pushed through the crowd of guests,
crying out, fiercely:</p>

<p>“The bride—let me see the bride!”</p>

<p>A wild hubbub arose as he advanced, for in the
hand that hung down at his side a score of eyes had
caught the gleam of a knife. Insane fury flashed
from his eyes as he advanced upon the beautiful
bride.</p>

<p>Her eyes dilated with terror, her face waxed
ghastly as she faced him, but not a sound came
from her pallid, parted lips.</p>

<p>“Ha! ha!” the intruder cried with a horrible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
laugh as he stopped so close to her that his hot
breath fanned her brow, while his eyes fairly devoured
her terrified face.</p>

<p>Then—</p>

<p>All in an instant, and as suddenly as he had rushed
upon her, the infuriated man fell back a pace and his
hand dropped to his side, while the glare of his eyes
changed to a stupid stare.</p>

<p>“You!” he muttered, “<i>you!</i>” and the murderous
knife fell from his hand upon the floor.</p>

<p>Some one shrieked aloud:</p>

<p>“A madman! Take him away!”</p>

<p>The men rushed upon him and dragged him from
the room. Molly clung sobbing to her new-made husband.</p>

<p>“Oh, Cecil,” she whispered, “he is not mad. It is
John Keith, my sister’s lover. He has made some
strange mistake, I am sure! He must have thought
it was his own sweetheart being married instead of
me! Oh, let me go and speak to him, poor tortured
Johnny!”</p>

<p>A shout came back from the hall.</p>

<p>The captive had broken loose and escaped into the
darkness of the night.</p>

<p>“I am so glad!” sighed Molly, with infinite relief.</p>

<p>And Cecil Laurens looked down at her with grave
eyes.</p>

<p>“Louise, are you sure the man is not an old lover
of yours?” he asked in a tone divided between jest
and earnest.</p>

<p>“I have never had a lover but you!” she replied,
fondly, and lifting her dark eyes to his face that he
might read the love written there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span></p>

<p>“Darling!” he whispered, rapturously, as he led
her to a seat.</p>

<p>Every one had run out into the hall to look after
the maniac, and they were for a moment alone.</p>

<p>Molly whispered, anxiously:</p>

<p>“Dear Cecil, don’t you pity that poor fellow? He
is not rich like you, and he can not find work enough
to support a wife! She is growing tired of waiting,
and he will lose her, unless something happens in his
favor. You will help him, Cecil? You’ll find him
some work?”</p>

<p>So earnest was the plaint that tears rushed into the
dark eyes, and Cecil, moved to sympathy, answered
ardently:</p>

<p>“I believe you are an angel, Louise, as I once
heard that unlucky fellow call you. Certainly, I’ll
try to find him some work; but I doubt if I’ll be doing
him a good turn helping him to marry selfish
Molly Trueheart. And then, you know, we leave tomorrow
on our wedding-tour, and shall not know
where to find him, as he has run away.”</p>

<p>“I know where to write to him. I have his address;
and, oh, Cecil, I shall love you more than
ever for <i>this</i>!” Molly cried, impetuously.</p>

<p>“Thanks, my little love. With that reward in view,
I shall strive earnestly to set your forlorn friend
up in business before we leave tomorrow,” Cecil
Laurens replied, gayly, but tenderly and earnestly.</p>

</div>


<p>Molly crossed with her noble, handsome husband
the beautiful ocean of which she had dreamed, and
the skies seemed to smile on the fair young bride,
for the weather was beautiful throughout, and the
water so smooth and calm that many of the passengers
escaped even a touch of seasickness. In ten days
they were in London, where the bride met her new
relatives, Cecil’s parents, and two school-girl sisters.
When she went to Paris she met there Doctor
Charlie Laurens, Cecil’s younger brother, who was
studying at the medical school in that gay city.</p>

<p>All of these new friends Molly found very agreeable
people, who were disposed to make a special pet of
Cecil’s wife, and who were pleased and happy as he
knew they would be because he had married a Barry.
They dwelt on this latter fact so much that it was
actual torture to Molly’s guilty soul.</p>

<p>“Oh, what will they say if they ever find me out?”
she sighed often to herself, and her sin weighed upon
her soul so heavily that even Cecil’s devotion fell
short of making her happy. There kept whispering
in her ear the still, small voice of conscience, and
sometimes she would sob bitterly when alone in
blind terror of the future, when she should be found
out in her sin.</p>

<p>But life went on very brightly for many months
in a whirl of gayety and pleasure. Mrs. Laurens,
who was fond of society, managed to have her beautiful
daughter-in-law presented at court, and after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
that invitations rained upon the beautiful couple.
London lavished admiration on the lovely American
bride, and Molly enjoyed it all with a feverish, fearful
pleasure, knowing that at any moment her house
of cards might tumble to pieces.</p>

<p>Mrs. Barry wrote her occasional letters from Ferndale,
and in one of them she said that she had written
to Lucy Everett all about her niece’s grand
marriage and tour to Europe. She added that they
had never answered the letter, by which she guessed
that she and that Trueheart girl were too angry and
envious to reply.</p>

<p>“They know it all now—oh, what will they do?”
the little fraud gasped in a fright, but months went
on and there came no signs from the real Louise
Barry.</p>

<p>“They do not care about it, or they are afraid to
speak as long as old Mrs. Barry lives,” the girl concluded
at last, gladly, and many were the prayers she
sent up to Heaven for the old lady’s long life.</p>

<p>“But will Heaven listen to such a sinner?” she
would often gravely exclaim at the close of these
petitions.</p>

<p>In the spring following her marriage she met, during
the London season, Sir Edward Trueheart, with
his wife and daughter, some country people who had
come up to the city to enjoy the pleasures of the
gay season, and were residing at their town house
in Park Lane. It was their name that attracted Molly
at first, and then they began to win upon her by a
subtle charm that she could not explain.</p>

<p>The cross old baronet and his faded, sad old wife,
with their handsome, rather elderly daughter, all took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
to the young American bride with pleased interest,
as she did to them. It was a mutual attraction.</p>

<p>Miss Trueheart, the daughter, was a tall, handsome
brunette, several years past thirty; but she had many
admirers, and among them one whom it was believed
she favored; but he knew, as did all the rest, that
Madelon Trueheart had declared she would never
marry as long as her mother lived.</p>

<p>Molly felt sorry for that pale, sad Lady Trueheart,
but sorrier still for Lord Westerly, Madelon’s faithful
lover, who had loved her so long and vainly. She
wanted these two to be happy, as she was with her
adored Cecil.</p>

<p>“Only, she would be happier still with her husband,
for no hidden barrier would lie between them,”
she sighed to herself.</p>

<p>It was odd what a close intimacy grew up between
the bride of seventeen and the woman of thirty-three.
They managed to be together very often, and Molly
went several times a week to the house in Park
Lane, and had the <i>entrée</i> of Miss Trueheart’s <i>boudoir</i>,
and even her dressing-room; so at last she felt bold
enough to keep a promise she had made Lord Westerly,
to plead his cause with his obdurate fair one.</p>

<p>“We have been lovers for ten years, Mrs. Laurens,
and my patience is almost exhausted,” he said. “I
have told Madelon that she might be with her mother
most of the time, but she seems to think nothing but
the sacrifice of her whole life will satisfy her parents.”</p>

<p>“It looks hard,” said cordial Molly, with misty
eyes. “I’ll speak to her for you, Lord Westerly.”</p>

<p>“Heaven bless you, you good little soul!” exclaimed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
his lordship, to whose forty years Molly
seemed nothing but a child.</p>

<p>So Cecil’s carriage rolled down Park Lane one day
and a vision of beauty stepped therefrom, and held
up her rosy lips for Cecil’s parting kiss, careless of
the coachman’s stare and the footman’s grin.</p>

<p>“Bye-bye, Cecil; call for me in an hour,” she said,
smiling, and after waiting until she had entered the
house, he went away.</p>

<p>The baronet was out, and Lady Trueheart was
shut up with her maid and a headache. Molly went
at once to Miss Trueheart’s <i>boudoir</i> and happily
found her alone.</p>

<p>“Now is my chance!” thought the lovely young
matron.</p>

<p>She brought the conversation cleverly around to
Lord Westerly, talked of his manly worth, his good
looks, his ample fortune: then she startled her
friend by crying out, abruptly:</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Trueheart, why don’t you marry this
good man and put him out of his pain?”</p>

<p>No one had ever arraigned Madelon Trueheart
like this before, and at first she was a little constrained
and stately in her answers.</p>

<p>“I have told Lord Westerly long ago that it was
useless waiting for me, and that he would do better
to love some woman who was free to leave her
mother and marry.”</p>

<p>“But, dear Miss Trueheart, daughters do leave
their mothers and marry,” remonstrated Molly.</p>

<p>“I shall never leave mine!” said Miss Trueheart,
firmly.</p>

<p>“She has her husband, even if you should leave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
her, and he ought to be sufficient comfort if she lost
all else!”</p>

<p>“But he is not, Mrs. Laurens, for he needs me almost
as much as she does. My father, although he
seems so cold and cross and sarcastic is in reality
almost near being broken-hearted as my mother. But,
dear Mrs. Laurens, how much surprised you look.
Has no one told you of our trouble?”</p>

<p>“Trouble?” Molly stammered.</p>

<p>“I should have said bereavement,” said Madelon
Trueheart, tears softening the glitter of her cold,
dark eyes, and Molly exclaimed, tenderly:</p>

<p>“Forgive me, I have heard nothing.”</p>

<p>“Then I must tell you, for I do not like for you to
think that my parents are selfish, and that I am cruel
to the man I love.”</p>

<p>“Forgive me for interfering. I did not know there
was anything serious behind your refusal to marry.”</p>

<p>“Listen,” said Madelon, gently, “I am not angry
with you for interfering. You did not know what
others do. Dear Mrs. Laurens, my parents had two
children once, a son and daughter. Their son, my
senior by several years, died in the prime of youth,
and it almost broke their hearts.”</p>

<p>“Died in his youth—oh, how sad!”</p>

<p>Tears that had been gathering on Molly’s lashes
rolled down her cheeks.</p>

<p>“That was not the saddest part of it,” said Madelon
Trueheart. “My dear, he was dead to us long
before the coffin lid covered his handsome face from
the sight of men. He offended my father and was
disinherited and driven from home because he contracted
a <i>mésalliance</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>

<p>“A <i>mésalliance</i>,” Molly faltered, with a half sob
that this time was for herself, not Madelon Trueheart’s
dead brother.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Madelon, sadly. “He was traveling
in America and in New York he fell in love with
a pretty actress. He married her and sent a letter
to tell us what he had done. Father cursed his only
son and forbade him to ever return to the home he
had disgraced.”</p>

<p>“An actress. It is always an actress that must
break hearts. What a cruel, wretched, proud world
it is,” Molly cried, with startling vehemence.</p>

<p>Madelon Trueheart looked at her in sad surprise.</p>

<p>“It is very kind of you to feel for us like that,”
she said. “It <i>was</i> bitter, was it not! We are such
an old family and so proud! But we loved Ernest
so—dear mother and I—that we would have forgiven
him, and made the best of his low-born bride.
But, alas, father would not have it so. He forbade
us sternly ever to think of the erring one again.
Then in just a little while—two years, no more—came
the message that he was dead.”</p>

<p>Molly lay back among the silken cushions of her
easy chair pale, but with burning eyes. She moved
her lips slightly in an almost inaudible whisper:</p>

<p>“Ernest—Ernest Trueheart.”</p>

<p>“Was it not dreadful?” sighed Madelon. “I think
father must have been gradually growing more tender,
for he almost went mad with remorse at the
news of Ernest’s early death. And mother, poor
soul, you can easily see that her heart is broken, and
her health fading. She has never held up her head
since he died, though it is nearly fifteen years ago.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
Can you blame me now, dear, that I feel it my first
duty to stay with my afflicted parents?”</p>

<p>Molly did not answer. She was sobbing softly in
her handkerchief, and Madelon went on:</p>

<p>“If Ernest’s wife would have come to us when he
died we would have received her, and loved her for
the sake of the dead. But she was proud as we had
been, and refused our proffers with scorn. Mother
wrote to her that if she had a child we wanted her
to give it to us. But she did not even reply. None
could blame her, could they since father had been so
hard at first?”</p>

<p>“What was her name?” asked Molly, almost in a
whisper.</p>

<p>“It was Molly Glenn—so plain and common,
father said, but Ernest wrote that she was good
and beautiful and a clever actress. I have no doubt
she was all three, for my brother was very fastidious.
But my story has been too sad for you, dear Mrs.
Laurens. It has grieved your gentle heart!”</p>

</div>


<p>Molly was saved from replying, for Miss Trueheart’s
maid knocked softly to say that Mr. Laurens
had called for his wife, and was waiting. Hurriedly
kissing her friend, the young wife ran down to join
her husband.</p>

<p>“Louise, my darling, your eyes are red. You have
been crying,” he said to her, full of solicitude.</p>

<p>“Miss Trueheart was telling me a sad story about
one of her friends,” she replied, evasively, and he
rejoined:</p>

<p>“I am sorry for that, for I, too, have a sad story
to relate—one that will distress you, I am sure.”</p>

<p>Molly gave a guilty start, and looked anxiously at
her husband. He was looking pale and grave.</p>

<p>“Some one has betrayed me,” she thought, with
her heart leaping into her throat, and his next words
confirmed her terror.</p>

<p>“Child, you have deceived me,” he said, with portentous
sternness.</p>

<p>The clear blue sky, the streets and houses, all
whirled up in a wild confusion before Molly’s blurred
sight. She fell heavily back against the carriage cushions,
and it seemed to her as if the hand of death
gripped her heart.</p>

<p>“Oh,” she moaned, in a faint, almost dying voice.
“I knew you would find me out some day, Cecil; for
the Lord’s sake forgive me!”</p>

<p>Cecil Laurens looked at his beautiful young wife
in amazement. She had grown ghastly pale, even to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
the lips, and her pallor was startling by contrast with
her dark hair and brows, and wild, dilated eyes. He
put his hand on hers and found that it was icy cold.</p>

<p>“My darling, my darling; do not look so frightened.
I am not an ogre. I am not going to kill you
for one little deception!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>He was afraid she was going to faint, but at those
kindly uttered words, the warm color rushed suddenly
into her face, and she turned her eyes on him,
with an expression little less than adoring.</p>

<p>“Cecil,” she murmured, in an indescribable tone,
leaning close to his shoulder, so close that he could
feel the convulsive trembling that shook her form.</p>

<p>He was alarmed, and exclaimed, reassuringly:</p>

<p>“Darling, your little deception did not matter
much. You kept the secret for your sister’s sake.
Remember, I am not blaming you much.”</p>

<p>“Yes, oh, yes, for <i>her</i> sake!” faltered the girl,
humbly. “I promised her never to betray it, but I
thought—thought you would be ready to <i>kill</i> me when
you found me out! And you take it easily as this?
Oh, my darling husband, you are an angel!”</p>

<p>“No, my dear, only a very faulty man, but passionately
in love with my charming wife,” returned
Cecil Laurens, with a wonderful sweetness in his
violet eyes. Then drawing a letter from his breast,
he added: “But you will want to read John Keith’s
letter?”</p>

<p>“John Keith!—was it he who betrayed me?”
Molly exclaimed, with sudden anger blazing from her
dark eyes.</p>

<p>“Darling, what does it matter now? The truth
could no longer be hidden. And your poor friend in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
writing to tell me that he was about to throw up his
situation and go south, gave as a reason for it that
dastardly divorce!”</p>

<p>“Divorce!”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear, but read it and see for yourself!”</p>

<p>“I—I can’t. The carriage goes too fast, and it
makes my head dizzy. Tell me, please,” Molly said,
with white lips and startled eyes.</p>

<p>Cecil replaced the letter in his pocket, and said,
excitedly:</p>

<p>“John Keith told me what you knew already—that
your sister Molly Trueheart had been his wife by a
secret marriage almost two years, and he added what
I suspected, that she was a mercenary, calculating
woman. She refused to live with him even after I
had placed him in a situation where he could support
her in comfort. Do not look so shocked, Louise,
darling, for I have more to tell you. She, his unworthy
wife, went away secretly from her old home,
and while in close hiding, secured a divorce from her
unlucky husband on a plausible plea of desertion and
non-support. Louise, <i>Louise</i>!”</p>

<p>The last words were uttered in a tone of alarm, for
his wife had quietly fainted away.</p>

<p>Fortunately, they were almost home, for they were
staying just then at The Acacias, a pretty, villa-like
residence occupied by Cecil’s parents.</p>

<p>“Drive faster!” Cecil thundered to the coachman,
and held Molly’s limp form tightly against his heart,
little dreaming that this was a parting embrace.</p>

<p>In a minute they paused in front of The Acacias,
and Cecil got out of the carriage and went through
the gate with his wife in his arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span></p>

<p>“Poor little one, I did not know she was so nervous
and weak. She has had too much excitement
lately, too much gayety. I must be more careful
with my tender-hearted little wife. I will take her
away from London for a time to some quiet retreat
where she can get her strength back,” he was thinking
as he went up the steps, and as he rang the bell
he pressed an adoring kiss on the pale face lying
on his breast.</p>

<p>The door was opened at once, and seeing the
drawing-room open and hearing his mother’s voice,
Cecil went in hastily with his burden.</p>

<p>He had not expected to find any one in the room
except his father and mother, but the first person his
eyes encountered was a stranger—a tall, handsome
woman with abundant hair of the color of dead-gold,
and eyes that matched the hair in hue with just a
little more of brightness caught from a yellowish
gleam in the dilated orbs. Brows and lashes of the
same peculiar color as her hair went with a clear-white
complexion brightened with a tint of rouge
upon the cheeks. Her tall, symmetrical figure was
draped in rich black silk and jet and a bonnet of
the same crowned her small head, the dark costume
intensifying her peculiar beauty.</p>

<p>Cecil Laurens’ gaze took in this stranger for just
an instant before he saw behind her a tall, gaunt
figure in gray silk that took him back with a rush
to Ferndale. It was old Mrs. Barry herself, grimmer
and grayer than ever, and with a stern aspect
that was enough to daunt the bravest soul.</p>

<p>Cecil laid his unconscious wife hurriedly down
upon a sofa and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Dear Mrs. Barry, this is very sudden and pleasant—but
see, my wife has fainted. Mother!”</p>

<p>Stately, aristocratic Mrs. Laurens trailed her silken
robes slowly across the room, her husband following,
until both stood in front of the sofa where Molly lay
in her unconscious beauty like one dead.</p>

<p>“She fainted in the carriage,” Cecil said, anxiously.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
“What must I do for her? Shall I summon
a physician?”</p>

<p>“No!” said a sharp, sibilant voice before Mrs.
Laurens could speak, and old Mrs. Barry crossed the
room stiffly and stood before Cecil.</p>

<p>In her feeble, cracked voice, sharpened by anger,
and with features distorted by fury, she exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Call nobody, do nothing, Cecil Laurens! Let the
impostor who tricked an old woman and fooled a
young man lie there and die! It is the best thing
that could happen to you both!”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Barry, you are certainly out of your mind!”
exclaimed the young man, indignantly. He had already
fallen down on his knees and was chafing
Molly’s cold, limp hands in both his own.</p>

<p>“Louise, Louise!” he called, anxiously, and the
lady in black silk rustled forward.</p>

<p>“That is <i>my</i> name, sir,” she said, coolly. “I am
Louise Barry, and that girl there,” contemptuously,
“is only Molly Trueheart, my step-sister, who became
your wife by one of the most stupendous frauds
ever perpetrated on a confiding man!”</p>

<p>He stared at her as he had done at Mrs. Barry,
and answered, angrily:</p>

<p>“You must be mad, woman! How dare you make
such an assertion?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Laurens burst into bitter tears and laid her
hand on his head.</p>

<p>“Oh, my son, it is the fatal truth!” she sighed.
“That girl there, your wife, whom we loved and respected
as one of the Barrys, is only the daughter of
the actress that Philip Barry married, and this lady is
indeed Miss Louise Barry.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p>“Mother, how can you say such false things?
Father, can you stand there silent and let them traduce
my pure and honorable wife?”</p>

<p>Mr. Laurens, who had a good, kind face, and
looked distressed beyond measure, replied, sadly:</p>

<p>“My poor Cecil, I fear it is the bitter truth. Mrs.
Barry has every proof that she was imposed on by
that poor girl there, who took advantage of her credulity
to make herself your wife.”</p>

<p>“I will not believe it!” thundered Cecil Laurens,
fiercely. He caught his mother’s vinaigrette from the
chain that secured it to her belt, and held it to
Molly’s nostrils. “My darling, my darling!” he cried,
frantically: “arise and face your accusers!”</p>

<p>But Molly never stirred from her death-like
swoon, and the golden-haired stranger cried out, imploringly:</p>

<p>“Oh, sir, listen to me, and I will convince you of
my truth! Aunt Thalia, after long years of estrangement
because of my father’s second marriage, wrote
to me that she had relented, and would make me her
heiress if I were still unmarried, but would have
nothing to do with me in case I were. She also invited
me to make her a visit, that we might become
acquainted with each other, as we had not met since
my early childhood.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes; that was what I wrote to Louise,” muttered
old Mrs. Barry, nodding her head till her cap-strings
fluttered as if in a breeze; and still Molly lay
there unconscious.</p>

<p>The new claimant resumed:</p>

<p>“That letter fell into the hands of my madcap
step-sister, Molly, instead of mine, and she instantly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
formed a clever plan of personating me, and becoming
my aunt’s heiress. She was a wild girl, and fond
of what she called ‘larks,’ and I suppose she thought
this would be a capital one. So she hid the letter
and ran away to Ferndale, arranging everything so
cleverly that we thought she had run away to marry
an objectionable lover whom she favored, one John
Keith.”</p>

<p>At that name a stifled groan escaped Cecil Laurens,
and Louise Barry said, quickly:</p>

<p>“Ah! you have heard of him, perhaps?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he muttered; and the scene of his wedding
night rushed freshly over Cecil, and a red-hot shaft
of jealous doubt tore through his heart.</p>

<p>“Then,” said Louise Barry, significantly. “I shall
say no more about John Keith as <i>she</i> is your <i>wife</i>.
What is the use,” pointedly, “of making bad matters
worse?”</p>

<p>“Hush!” he said, sternly, pointing to Molly, whose
breast began to heave with signs of returning life.</p>

<p>“She will have to know it all, so as well hear it
now as any other time,” said Louise Barry, and she
went on relentlessly, “About a month ago by an accident
I became possessed of the letter Aunt Thalia
had written to me, and I instantly suspected that I
had been deceived. My aunt, Mrs. Everett, wrote to
Mrs. Barry asking for information, and received all
the details of the impostor’s career up to the time of
her marriage with you. Then we went to Ferndale
and Aunt Thalia insisted that we should cross the
ocean and free you from the toils of an adventuress!”</p>

<p>“I will not believe this horrible story of my dear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
young wife. It is you who are the impostor, the adventuress!”
muttered Cecil, angrily.</p>

<p>“Aunt Thalia, will you show him the proofs?”
asked Louise Barry calmly, and with a cold, triumphant
gleam in her golden colored eyes.</p>

<p>Mrs. Barry eagerly produced them, and in the midst
of the heated argument Molly’s dark eyes opened suddenly
upon the scene with an incredulous stare, falling
first on Mrs. Barry’s ugly, angry face.</p>

<p>“Aunt Thalia—or, do I dream?” she exclaimed
weakly, and the old lady answered tartly:</p>

<p>“You’re waking up now from a very fine dream
that you’ve been dreaming almost a year, Molly Trueheart!”</p>

<p>Molly gave a gasp of terror. Her eyes had taken in
everything. Cecil’s stern white face, Louise Barry’s
triumphant one, and these coupled with Mrs. Barry’s
words, assured her that all was discovered, that her
dream of happiness was ended, her life with Cecil over
and done.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.</h2>
</div>


<p>Cecil was standing close to his wife with his arms
folded across his breast, his grave, troubled blue eyes
fixed anxiously on her face. She met that expressive
glance, cowered, shivered, and flung up her hands to
hide her guilty face.</p>

<p>At that expressive action in which Molly mutely acknowledged
her sin, a moment of intense silence fell.
Cecil Laurens himself broke it in a voice of poignant
anguish.</p>

<p>“It is true then, child? You have deceived Mrs.
Barry, deceived me, and become my wife under a borrowed
name!”</p>

<p>Molly drew one hand from before her face and
pointed at the real Louise Barry.</p>

<p>“It was <i>her</i> fault,” she said, passionately, and
Louise Barry answered, coldly:</p>

<p>“Do not add any more falsehoods to what you have
already done, Molly, for no one will believe you <i>now</i>!”</p>

<p>There was a veiled significance in the tone that the
poor, cowering girl understood but too well. Shudderingly
she lifted her dark eyes to the face of Cecil
Laurens which had suddenly grown ashy pale and
stern. She half extended her trembling hand to him.</p>

<p>“Cecil, you will believe me when I explain <i>all</i>?” she
said, beseechingly.</p>

<p>But he replied with unmoved sternness:</p>

<p>“First tell me, is it really true that that lady is the
real Louise Barry?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span></p>

<p>“It is true!” she replied, faintly, and shrinking from
the fierce anger that leaped into those blue eyes as she
acknowledged the truth.</p>

<p>“And you,” he exclaimed, in a low, deep voice of
angry bitterness and scorn, “you are the daughter of
the actress—you are Molly Trueheart!”</p>

<p>The ineffable scorn with which he named that name
fired her soul as it always did with sharp resentment,
and her eyes flashed with proud fire as she exclaimed:</p>

<p>“I am no longer Molly Trueheart, I am your wife,
Mrs. Laurens.”</p>

<p>Louise Barry’s voice, sharp and clear and cruel,
broke in maliciously:</p>

<p>“You are mistaken. Your marriage with Mr. Laurens
being contracted under a false name and personality
was illegal. You are therefore still Molly Trueheart,
and he—is free—free as air!”</p>

<p>Cecil Laurens gave a quick start, and looked at
Molly. Her face was white and wild with agony as
she sprang from the sofa and fell down at his feet.</p>

<p>“It is not—it is <i>not true</i>!” she gasped, in an agonized
voice. “Cecil, Cecil, I <i>am</i> your wife, you <i>are</i> my
husband! Speak, tell her she speaks falsely!”</p>

<p>He was blindly, madly angry at the deception that
had been practiced on him. In his bitter wrath and
outraged pride he caught quickly at Louise Barry’s
cue.</p>

<p>“Get up, Molly Trueheart, do not kneel at my feet,
for she speaks the truth!” he exclaimed, hoarsely.
“Such a marriage would not stand in law. I am
therefore free of you, as Miss Barry has just told
you.”</p>

<p>A shriek of mortal agony rang through the house;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
as Molly sprang upward and stood before the handsome,
angry man she loved, with an awful corpse-like
anguish on her girlish face. Her dark eyes clung to
his face despairingly, and she trembled like a wind-blown
leaf.</p>

<p>No one spoke or moved, so intensely was the interest
of all concentrated on those two central figures—the
outraged husband and the agonized young wife.
Ere her cry of anguish had ceased to re-echo through
the room, she wailed out, sharply, supplicatingly:</p>

<p>“You will forgive me, Cecil, you will make me your
wife, in truth, as I—thought I was. Oh, I can not
bear this shame! I sinned through my love of you,
and my remorse has been so great that I have never
known one happy hour. But you loved me, Cecil, and
you can not unlearn your love so soon. You will
make me your wife?”</p>

<p>Such tears as fell from her eyes were hot enough to
blister the fair face, such pain as racked her heart was
enough to atone for her sin, but the outraged husband
was wild with wrath, and he answered in that voice of
smoldering fury and indignant pride:</p>

<p>“Why, you are John Keith’s divorced wife. You
were bound to him when you went through that farce
of a marriage with me. Ah, I see through it all now,
but I can not understand how you duped him, so as to
get away with me, and then secure your divorce from
him. I—”</p>

<p>“Hush, you shall not accuse me of <i>that</i>,” she interrupted,
wildly. “There stands the heartless woman
who broke poor John Keith’s heart. She is his divorced
wife,” pointing an accusing finger at handsome
Louise Barry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span></p>

<p>The magnificent-looking beauty lifted her hands and
eyes to heaven with an expressive shrug of her graceful
shoulders.</p>

<p>“Heavens, what a false and wicked creature!” she
exclaimed. “Aunt Thalia, you have Aunt Lucy’s letter
telling you of Molly Trueheart’s entanglement with
John Keith although we did not know it had gone as
far as a secret marriage.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have the letter. Here, Cecil, read it,” exclaimed
Mrs. Barry, thrusting it into his hand.</p>

<p>Mechanically he ran his eyes over the open page,
but presently a little hand plucked timidly at his
sleeve.</p>

<p>“I do not believe Aunt Lucy Everett wrote those
falsehoods about me,” cried Molly, dauntlessly, “she
was a good woman and as kind to me as cruel Louise
would allow her to be. You see she has not followed
me to persecute me like these others.”</p>

<p>“She was sick and could not come,” Louise Barry
said, with scornful composure, and again a silence fell
that was broken by Cecil’s voice, low and stern:</p>

<p>“This letter has the stamp of truth upon it. I have
indeed been cruelly, shamelessly imposed on by an adventuress.”</p>

<p>“No, no!” in a voice of agonized remonstrance.</p>

<p>“Hush!” he said, looking at her sternly, rebukingly.
“I know you now for the false, treacherous creature
you are, and your denials will not be heeded. I have
loved you, but I will tear you out of my heart and life.
After this hour I will never willingly see your face
again.”</p>

<p>She cried out, desperately:</p>

<p>“Oh, for sweet pity’s sake take back your words. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
am not the vile creature you believe me. The only
wrong I have done was in wedding you under a false
name. But you will be merciful, you will repair that
ignorant deed, you will make me your real wife for
the sake of—” the beseeching prayer was never ended,
for exhausted nature gave way and the girl fell gasping,
and in a moment lay still as death upon the floor.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>She came to herself after what seemed a long, long
time, and found that she was alone in the room but
for her maid, who was bathing her face and hands in
<i>eau de Cologne</i>.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mrs. Laurens, I was afraid you were dead!”
she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“I wish I were!” sighed the poor girl, bitterly, realizing
all her desolation, and the maid, who had cleverly
found out all that had passed, thought that it would
indeed be better for the deserted wife.</p>

<p>She saw the dark eyes wandering wistfully around
the room, and said, compassionately:</p>

<p>“All the family are gone away, ma’am, and Mr.
Laurens gave me this note for you.”</p>

<p>Molly took it with trembling fingers and read the
angry words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The same roof could not shelter you and those
whom you deceived, traitress! so we have all gone
away and left you. Pray accept the use of the house
as long as you wish. It was taken for the season,
and no one will molest you in its occupancy. The
servants also you may command, but for myself and
my family we are from henceforth strangers to one so
false and wicked. Still, for the sake of the love I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
had for you <i>once</i>, I will arrange with my lawyers for
a sum to be paid you yearly, that you may be kept
from want or further sin. You may call on them and
get all particulars. Farewell forever.</p>

<p>The sheet of paper dropped from Molly’s fingers
and unconsciousness again stole over her—unconsciousness
so deep that she did not rouse at the furious
ringing of the door-bell that announced an impatient
visitor who a minute later was admitted into the room.</p>

<p>It was Cecil Laurens’ brother, Dr. Charley, who had
run over from Paris for a little visit with his home
folks, and who now cried out in amazement as he
stumbled and nearly fell over the form of his beautiful
sister-in-law.</p>

<p>Doctor Laurens had a profound admiration and regard
for his brother’s wife, and declared that Cecil,
who had always been a lucky fellow, had capped the
climax of his good fortune in securing such a beautiful
and charming bride. It was therefore with the
greatest consternation and distress that he beheld
Molly’s condition, and heard from the indignant maid
the cause of it—a cause which lost nothing in the
telling, for Phebe had warmly espoused the side of her
helpless young mistress.</p>

<p>Doctor Laurens ran his eyes hastily over his brother’s
letter that lay where it had fallen by Molly’s side,
and then he bent his attention to restoring her to life
from the deep swoon that had enchained her consciousness.</p>

<p>“Poor little girl, poor little girl!” he sighed over
and over as he lifted her in his strong young arms and
bore her to her chamber preceded by the attentive
maid, who turned down the covers of the white bed
and deftly disrobed Molly’s slight form, while Doctor
Laurens waited patiently outside.</p>

<p>“Now then, you may come in, sir,” she said, opening
the door; and entering quickly the young physician
exerted himself to the utmost limit of his skill in restoring
Molly to consciousness.</p>

<p>Phebe, who was an intelligent, middle-aged woman,
aided him all she could; but success came slowly, and
the woman cried out in alarm that she feared her
young mistress was dead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span></p>

<p>“No, she is not dead. Her heart beats faintly. She
will revive presently,” said Doctor Laurens, and he
added something in an undertone at which the woman
exclaimed, excitedly:</p>

<p>“I thought so myself, and I hinted it to the dear
child sometime ago, but she was so bashful she would
not believe me. Oh, this makes it all the worse for
the poor creature, and Mr. Laurens was cruel to leave
her, no matter what she had done.”</p>

<p>Doctor Laurens answered, gravely:</p>

<p>“I am sure my brother did not know this important
fact or he would have acted differently, Phebe.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said the woman, dropping him a profound
courtesy.</p>

<p>“Are any of the servants beside yourself aware of
what has happened?”</p>

<p>The woman answered promptly in the negative.</p>

<p>“I saw Mr. Laurens bringing my mistress into the
house in his arms and ran into the room to assist her—that
is how I overheard all,” she said, with such a
frank, truthful air that Doctor Laurens immediately
enjoined:</p>

<p>“You seem to be a good, intelligent woman, Phebe,
and I want you to keep this secret locked in your own
breast. Will you do so?”</p>

<p>“It shall never pass my lips, sir; for I’m sure my
poor young lady never did all them dreadful things
that lady said.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Phebe, for your confidence in my
sister-in-law. She does not look like an arrant sinner,
does she, with that sweet, innocent face? Any way,
no matter how she has sinned, her condition gives her
a claim on my brother that he can not in honor disregard.
So we will try to patch up a reconciliation between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
them, and a remarriage may be necessary. I
speak frankly to you, Phebe, seeing what a good
woman you are, and devoted to that poor girl,” said
the young man.</p>

<p>“Devoted—yes indeed, sir, for no servant ever had
a sweeter, kinder mistress,” said the woman, in tears.</p>

<p>“Then you understand the vital necessity of saving
her name from scandal, and I need caution you no
more about the strict keeping of her secret,” said the
young physician as he again bent over his patient, in
whom he detected signs of returning life.</p>

<p>In fact Molly’s eyes opened languidly a few minutes
later with a puzzled air at finding herself in bed with
the gas lighted in the room, whereas her last recollection
had been of the sunset hour.</p>

<p>“Cecil,” she murmured, with a restless movement,
and Phebe said, soothingly:</p>

<p>“He is not here just this moment, Mrs. Laurens.
You have been sick, and here is your brother-in-law,
the doctor, who has been attending to you.”</p>

<p>She met Charley Laurens’ compassionate blue eyes
fixed on her, and instant consciousness returned to her
mind. Burying her face in the pillow her slight form
shook heavily with anguished sobs.</p>

<p>“Let her alone, Phebe. Let nature have its way,
and she will feel better after weeping,” said the sympathetic
young doctor.</p>

<p>He was right, for when the tempest of sobs and
tears had exhausted itself Molly began to grow quiet,
and at last turned her pathetic, wet eyes on his face,
and said, with a sort of wistful anger:</p>

<p>“Why are you here when all the rest have turned
against me and gone away?”</p>

<p>He answered, gently:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span></p>

<p>“I came and found you sick and alone save for your
faithful maid. I stayed then to help to make you
well.”</p>

<p>With a restless movement she rejoined:</p>

<p>“I do not want to get well! You ought to know
that. I want to die!”</p>

<p>“That is nonsense, my dear little sister, and I do
not want to hear any more of it,” was the cheerful
response.</p>

<p>“Do you know all?” she asked, looking fixedly at
him.</p>

<p>“Phebe has told me as well as she could, so I don’t
want you to talk about it tonight, as you are in too
excited a state to do so. I have a little powder here
which I want you to take so that you may sleep well
tonight, for I must go away in a little while and leave
you in your good Phebe’s care,” he said, gently, like
one speaking to a sick child.</p>

<p>“Then I shall be quite deserted,” she murmured,
plaintively.</p>

<p>“No, for I shall come again.”</p>

<p>“When?” pleadingly.</p>

<p>“Tomorrow.”</p>

<p>She caught his arm as he bent down to hold the
medicine glass to her lips.</p>

<p>“You do not look scornful like the rest,” she panted.
“Ah, won’t you—won’t you—beg <i>him</i> to forgive me?
I was wicked, I know, but I have suffered so much
since that it almost seems as if my remorse and sorrow
had washed out my sin. And—I loved him so! How
could I help it when we loved each other so, and that
secret would have parted us forever? Tell him, tell
him—” her voice broke in hysterical sobs, and he
pushed her gently back among the pillows as he said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll see him. Only be quiet, dear, and I’ll tell him
all you said and more, for he shall know the sweet
secret you have been hiding from him—the secret that
will surely bring him back to you.”</p>

<p>“No, no, he will not return; he has left me forever,”
she sobbed, and turned her face from him so that it
was hidden from sight. He sat down patiently until
the heaving breast grew quiet in the stillness of a
drugged sleep, then leaving her in Phebe’s watchful
care, went in search of his brother.</p>

<p>It was only as he went down the steps of The Acacias
and out into the gas-lighted street that he remembered
that he had not the address to which his relatives
had gone.</p>

<p>“But it is to the Langham, of course. They always
go there when they have not taken a house in town,”
he said to himself, and turned his steps thitherward.</p>

<p>“It is early, thank Heaven, so they will not have
retired or gone out,” he thought, as he walked slowly
along, pondering over the painful affair, and feeling
profoundly sad at the thought of Molly’s treachery.</p>

<p>“Her youth is her only excuse, and yet it seems
strange that one so young and seemingly guileless
could have conceived and carried out such a clever,
wicked plan,” he thought, in wonder, and knowing
Cecil’s proud, honest nature as he did he could not feel
surprised at the latter’s indignant action in deserting
the girl who had thus deceived him.</p>

<p>“But according to Phebe’s description the real
Louise Barry can not be one-half as charming as the
pretended one,” he said to himself, recalling with
some amusement the maid’s spiteful description of the
latter as a “yellow-headed, yellow-eyed, deceitful cat.”</p>

<p>His musings brought him at last to the Langham,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
where he found as he had hoped and expected, his
father, mother and brother registered.</p>

<p>He sent up his card, and his father sent down to
him to come upstairs to their private parlor, where
he found his parents looking pale and dejected as they
sat together alone.</p>

<p>Molly slept quietly the long night through, under the
influence of the doctor’s soothing medicine, and it was
far into the morning when she awakened and found
her faithful Phebe sitting by her side.</p>

<p>“Well, I thought you were going to sleep all day,
Mrs. Laurens,” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>Molly started and rolled her heavy dark eyes around
the room.</p>

<p>“Has—has—any one been here to see me?” she
queried, faintly, an instant remembrance of her woes
rushing over her mind.</p>

<p>“Yes, madame,” Phebe answered, and a wild light
of hope flashed into the big, pathetic eyes of her mistress.</p>

<p>“Not—not,” she exclaimed, and choked with painful
emotion, unable to utter another word.</p>

<p>“No, not your husband, my dear, but his brother,
Doctor Charley,” said Phebe, gently stroking the little
hand that lay outside the cover, nervously beating the
silken counterpane. “He came and found you sleeping
so sweetly that he said he would not wait, as he
was in a hurry to catch a train for Paris.”</p>

<p>“He has gone! My last friend has deserted me,”
Molly exclaimed in sudden, keen disappointment and
despair.</p>

<p>“Not so bad as that, Mrs. Laurens, for he left a
note that he said would explain all.”</p>

<p>“Give it to me, Phebe,” cried the poor child, sitting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
upright in bed and holding out her eager little
hands.</p>

<p>She tore off the envelope in hot haste and read the
hurriedly penciled lines with that morning’s date.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“My poor little sister, I failed to find Cecil last
night. Like a coward he has run away from his misery,
and I have just found out that he has gone to
Paris. I must follow him at once, for I mean to bring
him back to you. Take heart, be of good cheer, little
one, and remain where you are until I come back with
Cecil. I have talked to mother and father; but in the
first keenness of their trouble they are obdurate. But
be patient. They will all come round in time and forgive
you for the sake of what is coming, and because
you were so young and ignorant. Adieu.</p>

<p class="right right-indent">
“<span class="smcap">Charley.</span>”<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>“God bless him! God bless him for his noble
heart!” Molly cried, with streaming eyes. “Oh,
Phebe, is it not noble in him to befriend me when they
have all forsaken me?”</p>

<p>“I have stood by you, too, Mrs. Laurens. Do not
forget my love although it is so humble,” cried the
faithful maid.</p>

<p>Molly flung herself gratefully into her arms, and
sobbed out her passionate thanks with raining tears.</p>

<p>“Yesterday I was rich in friends, but today I have
no one but you, dear Phebe, and Doctor Charley,” she
sighed.</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear, do not take it so hard. All will
come right again. There now, lie down on your pillow,
and let me bring you some breakfast,” she said,
abruptly, to hide her emotion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span></p>

<p>Molly lay there still and pale upon the pillow with
quick tears raining from her forlorn eyes and drenching
her cheeks.</p>

<p>“It will never come right again—how should it?”
she moaned. “I am found out at last in my sin and
punishment has fallen on me. Alas, the way of the
transgressor is indeed hard.”</p>

<p>She had always known that discovery would come
some time, that punishment would overtake her, that
she would have to repent in dust and ashes for her
strange sin; but that it would come like this, with this
horrible disgrace upon its track she had no more
dreamed than she had dreamed of being Queen of
England, or any other impossible thing.</p>

<p>“I have been loved by him. I have lived with him,
believed myself his wife. I am soon to bear a child
to him, yet I am not his wife, never have been, and
now he scorns and deserts me. Yet I brought it all
upon myself by my ignorance and madness,” she
sighed to herself, and so agonizing was this knowledge
to the young, devoted heart that it was a wonder that
it did not kill her outright. She would have been glad
if it had done so, for death would have been a welcome
relief from the anguish of soul and body that
she was enduring.</p>

<p>“God pardon my sin, and take me out of the world!”
she prayed, despairingly, and there came over her a
great wonder at herself that she had come to such a
terrible pass.</p>

<p>“Am I dreaming? Is this indeed Molly Trueheart
who a year ago was a child with no higher aim than
fun and frolic, with a heart as light as thistledown?
Great Heaven, why did I ever let them send me to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
Ferndale? Nothing but despair and disgrace has come
of it, and I have ruined my life forever for a few
months of bitter-sweet bliss,” she moaned, flinging
up her hands and beating the air impatiently in impotent
despair.</p>

<p>The door opened and Phebe entered with a tempting
breakfast arranged on a silver service.</p>

<p>But Molly pushed the dainty viands loathingly
away.</p>

<p>“As if I could eat while my poor heart is breaking,”
she said, with pathetic eyes, and just then there came
a light tap at the door.</p>

<p>Phebe sat down the tray and found one of the servants
waiting.</p>

<p>“A lady to see Mrs. Laurens,” he said. “I told her
she was sick, but she insisted, and—” he broke off
with a start, for the visitor was just behind him.</p>

<p>“I knew Mrs. Laurens would not mind, because I
am such an old friend,” she twittered, insolently, and
pushed past Phebe into the room.</p>

<p>It was Louise Barry, handsome and smiling, in a
rich costume of dark silk and velvet.</p>

<p>“Oh, Molly, in bed yet? Luxury has taught you
bad habits,” she exclaimed with a light laugh.</p>

<p>“My mistress is sick, madame,” exclaimed Phebe,
banging the door shut, and turning on the visitor with
sharp displeasure.</p>

<p>“Go away, Louise! I can’t bear the sight of you!”
Molly cried, fretfully; but Miss Barry sank coolly into
the easiest chair in the luxurious room.</p>

<p>“Your manners are as bad as of old, Molly,” she
retorted, insolently. “But send your maid away,
please; I want to talk to you privately.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t want you to talk to me. I won’t send
Phebe away!” Molly cried out, defiantly, with flashing
eyes.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>
</div>


<p>Phebe planted herself aggressively in front of Miss
Barry.</p>

<p>“You must please go out and not disturb my sick
mistress any longer, ma’am,” she said politely, but
firmly.</p>

<p>Louise measured her from head to foot with an
insolent glance of the handsome yellow-brown eyes.</p>

<p>“Nonsense, woman,” she replied curtly. “I came
here to have a private conversation with my step-sister,
and I intend to do so. Therefore, the longer you
remain and hinder my desire, the longer I shall stay
here and annoy you.”</p>

<p>Phebe looked decidedly belligerent, as she exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Shall I put her out of the room and lock the door,
Mrs. Laurens? I’ll do it if you say the word.”</p>

<p>Molly looked sorely tempted to say yes, but she
turned again to Louise.</p>

<p>“<i>Will</i> you go away and leave me in peace? I do
not want to have any trouble with you, Louise,” she
said, pleadingly.</p>

<p>“I will not go until I get ready. You ought to know
me better, Molly, than to oppose me like this. You
know, of old, that I always have my own way.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you have always done so—to my despair and
destruction,” Molly groaned, bitterly, but Louise gave
an incredulous laugh.</p>

<p>“I had nothing to do with your marrying Cecil Laurens,”
she observed, dryly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span></p>

<p>“You made it impossible for me to decline doing so
without putting your interest in jeopardy,” Molly retorted.</p>

<p>“I think I told you I would not discuss private matters
before your maid, Molly. Are you ready to send
her away?”</p>

<p>“Since I can not get rid of you without—yes,” cried
Molly, petulantly, overruled as she had always been
by the other’s despotic will.</p>

<p>“You may retire a few moments, Phebe; but remain
within call,” she said to the maid, who went out
reluctantly, and with a resentful toss of her head
toward Miss Barry.</p>

<p>Then they looked fixedly at each other, the handsome,
insolent woman and the pale, wretched girl.</p>

<p>“Oh, Louise, how did you have the heart to do
all that you have done?” Molly cried out, passionately.</p>

<p>“You can ask me that? After your treachery to
Cecil Laurens?” scornfully.</p>

<p>“You were to blame. Why did you make me stay
there when I begged to come away? I shall tell Cecil
everything, and then he can not in justice be so hard
on me,” Molly exclaimed, passionately; but she shrank
from the cold, cruel smile that curled the red lips of
her handsome step-sister.</p>

<p>“You will tell him nothing. He would not believe
you if you went down on your knees to him. Besides,
I wonder how you can think of telling him anything,
of ever seeing him again even, when he has deserted
you and gone away rejoicing that you were not his
wife, and refusing to repair your disgrace.”</p>

<p>A low, anguished moan was the only reply of the
girl whose face was buried in the bed-clothes, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
those low, stinging words had maddened her with
shame.</p>

<p>Louise went on, icily:</p>

<p>“I came here this morning to offer to help you in
your arrangements for going away. I expected to find
you gone already indeed, for how can you have the
hardihood to stay here in Cecil Laurens’ house after
what has happened? He is nothing to you, less than
nothing!”</p>

<p>“Hush, Louise! I am his wife in the sight of
Heaven!” the wretched wife cried out in passionate
denial, and the utter agony of her face might have
moved a heart of stone, but Louise Barry was pitiless.</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” she said, curtly. “Your marriage
under a false name and identity is utterly void in law,
and Cecil Laurens was quick to take advantage of the
fact. You are a disgraced creature, and nothing remains
to you but flight to some far secluded spot,
where none who know you now can ever hear of you
again.”</p>

<p>Molly sat upright among her pillows, and her eyes
flashed resentfully.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, that is what you would like!” she exclaimed.
“You want to hustle me out of sight somewhere,
thinking that I shall never have the opportunity
of telling Cecil the part you took in sending me to
Ferndale under a borrowed identity; but I shall tell
him <i>all</i> when I see him again, and then he shall judge
between us.”</p>

</div>


<p>Suddenly Miss Barry arose from her seat, stepped
quickly to the bed, and caught Molly’s hot, writhing
hands in both her strong, cool, white ones. It was a
fierce, vindictive grasp that pained Molly’s tender
wrists, and, looking up with frightened eyes, she saw
that Louise’s face was working with fury.</p>

<p>“Look at me, Molly Trueheart!” she hissed, savagely,
and Molly’s dark, piteous, tearful orbs lifted
reluctantly to meet that gaze filled with tigress fury.</p>

<p>Louise continued, fiercely:</p>

<p>“Since you came to live with us as a child, Molly,
have you ever known me to give up anything on which
I had set my heart?”</p>

<p>“No,” sighed the trembling girl.</p>

<p>“Have I not forced you in every instance where our
wills clashed to yield to me?”</p>

<p>“Ye-es,” half sobbed the agonized victim, with a
shudder.</p>

<p>“Very well, then, since you own this, Molly, you
ought not to be surprised that I intend to adhere to
my purpose. So I say now, briefly, and for all, that
you shall never betray my part in your going to my
aunt at Ferndale. I have told Cecil Laurens that it
was all your treachery, and you shall not betray me!”</p>

<p>“But I will! I must! Oh, Louise, you must be
mad to think I could let him go on thinking so hardly
of me! I shall tell him, or Doctor Charley, or—or—any
one who will listen to me,” piteously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span></p>

<p>“No one will listen to you, you little fool!” Louise
hissed, angrily.</p>

<p>She pinched the little wrists tighter in her fierce
grasp, and gave Molly such a vicious shake that she
cried out in pain and terror.</p>

<p>Bending lower, she went on, cruelly:</p>

<p>“Do you know what I would do to you, Molly, if
you attempted to betray me?”</p>

<p>“No-o, Louise! Oh, let go my hands, you hurt
me!”</p>

<p>“Never mind your hands; I’ll pinch them as long as
I choose! I ought to beat you for your ill-behavior,
but I won’t. You’re getting too big to be punished that
way now. But, Molly, if you ever come between me
and my plans, if you ever tell what you know of me,
<i>I’ll kill you</i>!”</p>

<p>“I—I’m not afraid!” muttered Molly, but her teeth
chattered, and her slight form shook as if with an
ague chill.</p>

<p>“You <i>are</i> afraid! You are almost dead with terror
this minute, for you know <i>me</i>, Molly Trueheart! and
you know I’ll keep my word as sure as there’s a God
in heaven, or a devil in hell!” menacingly exclaimed
her persecutor.</p>

<p>Molly’s head drooped wearily a moment, and heavy,
labored sighs rose from her tortured breast.</p>

<p>“I wish I were dead!” she sighed, bitterly, to herself;
then she looked up with sudden defiance at
Louise, and said, with passionate emphasis:</p>

<p>“Very well, then, Louise, I’ll dare all for the sake
of having Cecil know the truth, for he could not think
quite so badly of me then, and perhaps he would pity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
me a little in my early grave after I had been murdered
for telling him the truth!”</p>

<p>Louise dropped the little hands, and stepping back a
pace, regarded Molly in silent, vengeful fury. There
was so deadly a wrath in the look that the sick girl
cowered and shivered, and fell to rubbing the soft
wrists and hands that were black and blue from the
cruel grasp of Louise’s hands.</p>

<p>“You defy me, you weak, puny thing!” the latter
hissed, fiercely. “Molly Trueheart, you must be mad,
indeed. Do you think I will leave you here now to
betray me?”</p>

<p>Molly looked at her in sudden apprehension.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” she faltered.</p>

<p>“I’m going to take you away from this house and
hide you where you can never find any one to listen
to your story,” her tormentor answered, audaciously.</p>

<p>She sat down again in the great purple velvet chair,
and looking insolently at her victim, observed coolly:</p>

<p>“I’m going to sit here until you faint, and then I
shall carry you out to my carriage and drive off with
you.”</p>

<p>“I’m—not—going—to faint!” Molly muttered, but
her lips were purple already, and her eyes dim, while
a horrible sinking feeling stole over her form.</p>

<p>She struggled desperately against it, and Louise
Barry laughed, mockingly.</p>

<p>“You will be unconscious in five minutes,” she said.
“I see it stealing over you, now. You are worn out
by all that you have suffered, and you can not bear up
against your terror of me!”</p>

<p>Molly knew that her enemy’s words were true. Already
a subtle weakness was stealing over her, and she
saw Louise’s handsome, mocking, cruel face dimly, as
through a blood-red mist. She felt as if a deadly
vampire were feasting on her life-blood and struggled
wildly to cry out, to call assistance in her terrible need.</p>

<p>But her lips seemed parched and dry, her tongue
clung to the roof of her mouth, feeling stiff and swollen
and almost paralyzed. Life seemed swiftly ebbing,
and her foe sat there watching her gloatingly. A moment
of sharp, cruel, agonized struggling against the
awful sensation, and Molly swooned as her enemy had
predicted.</p>

<p>It was the hour of Louise’s triumph.</p>

<p>She ran into the dressing-room and quickly possessed
herself of a long cloth cloak with a hood. Running
back, she threw aside the bed-covers and flung
the cloak around Molly’s form. Then she attempted
to lift the girl in her strong arms and bear her away
as she had threatened.</p>

<p>To her surprise she found that the burden was too
heavy for her strength and dropped it back on the bed
with a muttered exclamation of dismay.</p>

<p>“Why, I have lifted her up and shaken her a hundred
times. What does this mean?” she exclaimed,
and flung back the cloak from the silent form.</p>

<p>A cry of rage escaped her lips, and her eyes flashed
with fury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span></p>

<p>She had found out Molly’s shyly guarded secret at
a glance.</p>

<p>Louise Barry almost went wild with rage at this
discovery. She pushed Molly’s silent form rudely
from her, and exclaimed, angrily:</p>

<p>“I hate her more than ever now, for if he knows
this he will return to her for his own honor’s sake.
What shall I do, what shall I do to keep them apart,
for my secret will be betrayed it she meets him again.”</p>

<p>The door opened and Phebe stalked in, grim and
anxious. When she saw Molly lying pallid and unconscious
on the bed, she uttered a cry of alarm and
pushed Louise roughly away.</p>

<p>“What have you done to my poor young mistress?”
she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“I have done nothing. It is a faint, simply,” Louise
answered, carelessly.</p>

<p>“It looks like death,” Phebe muttered, bringing
<i>eau-de-Cologne</i> to lave the girl’s face and hands. Her
eyes at that moment fell on the thick cloak. “Who
put this cloak here?” she exclaimed, suspiciously.</p>

<p>“I did. She seemed so chilly that I laid it over her
to keep her warm,” the wily woman answered, coolly.</p>

<p>Phebe turned upon her, her rough, homely face pale
with anger.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you,” she said, bluntly. “I believe
you’ve tried to spirit Mrs. Laurens away, and I came
in here just in time to prevent you!”</p>

<p>“How dare you talk to me so, woman? I have a
right to take her away if I choose. She is my step-sister,
and I am the guardian of her honor.”</p>

<p>“You’re her tormentor, and you’ve made all this
mischief between her and her husband, and if you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
don’t get out of here pretty quick I’ll put you out by
force!” stormed Phebe, losing her temper, in her resentment
against the audacious intruder.</p>

<p>“I shall stay here as long as I please, and I dare you
to interfere with me!” Louise answered, insolently,
but she had miscalculated the will and the strength of
Molly’s defender, for the next instant she felt herself
lifted off her feet and carried out of the room, along
the hall and down the stairs like a whirlwind in the
arms of angry Phebe, who never stopped until she
opened the front door, pushed her victim out on the
steps, and slammed and locked the door in her startled
face.</p>

</div>


<p>Then Phebe turned to two astonished footmen who
stood grinning and wondering in the hall.</p>

<p>“If any of you men ever let that woman into this
house again it will cost you both your situations!”
she said, sharply, and flew upstairs again to her mistress.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Louise Barry, chagrined and foiled, and
silently vowing revenge, went down the steps to her
carriage, and to her dismay encountered Mrs. Laurens
the elder, who had also alighted from her carriage,
and just at the foot of the steps witnessed with dismay
Louise’s summary ejectment from the house.</p>

<p>“My dear Miss Barry, what does this mean?” she
ejaculated, without waiting for the preliminaries of a
formal greeting.</p>

<p>Louise put on her most injured air.</p>

<p>“You saw that woman put me out of the house by
force?” she inquired.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“That was some more of Molly Trueheart’s work,”
Louise exclaimed, seeing here another opportunity to
injure her victim.</p>

<p>“Impossible! She could not be so mean!”</p>

<p>“Ah, Mrs. Laurens, you can not gauge the depths
of Molly Trueheart’s wickedness. I went to her on a
mission of sisterly kindness and she repulsed me, insulted
me, and with the help of that great amazon, her
maid, forcibly ejected me from the house.”</p>

<p>“After all I had heard I would not have believed she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
could be guilty of this!” Mrs. Laurens exclaimed in
horror.</p>

<p>“She is incorrigible,” Louise said, with a heavy
sigh. “I went to her and offered to take her away
and provide for her, knowing that your son’s house
could no longer be a home for her, and pitying her in
spite of the injury she had done me. But—well, you
saw, Mrs. Laurens, what reception I met from that
erring girl!”</p>

<p>“Dreadful!” sighed Mrs. Laurens in profound distress.</p>

<p>“Is it not?” exclaimed Louise, adding, eagerly,
“Will you not aid and abet me, dear madame, in removing
her, by force if necessary, from this house that
is no longer a proper shelter for her head?”</p>

<p>“Ah, that I only might. The task would be most
grateful,” Mrs. Laurens answered. “But a far different
purpose is mine now.”</p>

<p>“Different?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Miss Barry, different and most unwelcome.
Instead of banishing that wretched girl from this roof
forever, I am here to protect her from the consequences
of her sin, to shield her by my presence from
the faintest breath of scandal. In short, to keep the
world from ever knowing the story of her folly and
sin.”</p>

<p>Louise paled and trembled.</p>

<p>“Dear madame, what can you mean?” huskily.</p>

<p>“I mean that since yesterday embarrassing exigencies
have arisen that make it impossible for us to desert
Molly Trueheart, great as her treachery has been;”
and in a few words she told Louise what she already
knew—the condition of Molly—that made it imperative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
on Cecil, for his own honor’s sake, to give her
once more the shelter of his name.</p>

<p>“You will not have him marry her over again!
Good heavens, that will be putting a premium on her
treachery, and—and—he hates her now. She could
never be his beloved again!” Louise cried, in wild
alarm and secret rage.</p>

<p>“No he can never tolerate her again, she will never
be aught but his wife in name only. He will spend
his time apart from her, of course; but to the world
she must still appear an honored and beloved wife for
the sake of the child that is coming to Cecil. We are
all coming back here to stay in order to keep up appearances
before prying eyes; but, of course, our intercourse
with her will be of the barest sort. She will be
despised among us, and it will be a mercy to us all if
Providence should remove her from Cecil’s way when
the hour of her trial comes,” cried Mrs. Laurens, resentfully.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>
</div>


<p>Louise Barry went away from that meeting with
Mrs. Laurens with a heart burning with secret wrath
and jealousy.</p>

<p>“Am I going to be foiled like this, betrayed like this
by that chit of a girl?” she muttered gloomily.</p>

<p>Her prospects did indeed look dark, for if Molly
should tell what she knew and get any one to believe
her, Louise’s fortune for which she had schemed and
plotted would be ruined.</p>

<p>“Aunt Thalia would certainly drive me away from
her forever if she found out about John Keith and the
deception I practiced to gain her fortune,” she thought,
fearfully, and her wrath against Molly grew and
strengthened with every hour.</p>

<p>“I could kill her—the little mar-plot! Why did she
marry Cecil Laurens? All would have gone well but
for that!” she muttered, clinching her hands angrily
again as she had done when Molly’s helpless fingers
lay between them.</p>

<p>When she reached the Langham where she and old
Mrs. Barry had luxurious apartments, she went at
once and told her aunt the same garbled story she had
told Mrs. Laurens about her summary ejectment from
The Acacias.</p>

<p>The old lady was furious.</p>

<p>“She ought to be hung—that Molly Trueheart!”
she exclaimed, viciously, and Louise answered, with
equal venom:</p>

<p>“Yes, but instead of being punished for her sin they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
are going to shield her from disgrace and drive poor
Cecil Laurens into a new entanglement with her for
the sake of a scruple of honor.”</p>

<p>“It shall not be. It is the wish of my heart that
Cecil should marry you. We <i>must</i> prevent this sacrifice!”
Mrs. Barry stormed.</p>

<p>“But how, Aunt Thalia?”</p>

<p>“Send for that John Keith wherever he is, Louise.
I’ll bribe him to take her away before they push Cecil
into a second marriage!”</p>

<p>Louise grew pale as ashes, and clinched her hands
tightly together in her lap.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you say to my plan, eh, why don’t
you speak?” demanded the grim old lady, sharply.</p>

<p>“It—will—not—answer. He is at the other side of
the world. I should not know where to send for him,
and I am quite sure he would refuse to have any more
to do with his faithless wife,” Louise answered,
slowly, with averted face.</p>

<p>“The little baggage! I should not blame him!”
snapped Mrs. Barry, her seamed and wrinkled face
working with anger. She went on, impatiently:
“Well, then we must think of some other plan. That
marriage must never take place.”</p>

<p>“No, they must be kept apart. We must think of
something else,” Louise answered, but it was easier
proposing plans than carrying them out. Fate, that
had played poor Molly so many ill turns in her brief
life, seemed relenting a little now.</p>

<p>None of the plans which the plotters proposed to
each other could be carried out, for Cecil Laurens did
not come home with Doctor Charley, although he was
daily and hourly expected, and Louise was unable to
gain an entrance into The Acacias, although she called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
daily and tried to send in her card to Cecil’s mother.</p>

<p>The servants, mindful of Phebe’s threat, always
shut the door in her face and refused to take cards or
messages.</p>

<p>“Young Mrs. Laurens is lying ill, and the family
receive no visitors,” was what she heard daily, and
old Mrs. Barry, when she called one day, fared no
better.</p>

<p>“She must really be sick,” Louise said, when her
aunt returned from the fruitless attempt, and she
added to herself with a guilty blush: “I hope she will
die!”</p>

<p>To the faithful Phebe, who hung anxiously over the
sick-bed, it seemed as if this wish would come true,
for Molly was very ill after she recovered from the
swoon into which she had fallen from sheer terror of
her foe. A physician had to be summoned at once,
and he pronounced the patient in a dangerous condition,
and charged Phebe to be very careful lest by the
slightest neglect that young life should be lost.</p>

<p>Phebe carried out his orders with patient, unswerving
devotion, knowing well that in this dark hour she
was the sufferer’s only friend.</p>

<p>And indeed she had to fight for this position, and
hold it in the teeth of the elder Mrs. Laurens’ grim
displeasure, for Louise’s artful tale had so wrought
upon that lady’s feelings that she immediately sought
out Phebe and told her to take her discharge with a
mouth’s wages instead of the customary warning.</p>

<p>“Indeed, then, mem, with all due respect to your
gray hair, I can’t take my discharge from anybody but
Mr. Cecil himself. He it was that engaged me, mem,
and I promised him I’d be a faithful servant to my
young mistress, so how could I desert her now in her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
trouble, when every one has gone against her and she
hasn’t a friend but me?” expostulated Phebe.</p>

<p>“You are impertinent, woman!” Mrs. Laurens exclaimed,
with a frown.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry you think so, mem; I don’t mean to be
so, but I can’t desert my mistress now.”</p>

<p>“I shall engage a sick-nurse,” Mrs. Laurens said
loftily.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, mem, but you couldn’t find a
better sick-nurse than me anywhere, if I <i>do</i> say it myself,”
said Molly’s stanch friend sturdily; and so she
held her situation in the teeth of all opposition.</p>

<p>It was not an enviable task she had either, for all
the care of the invalid devolved upon her and the
physician; Mrs. Laurens only making two short calls
daily, morning and evening—calls that never exceeded
five minutes in duration, and which did the sick girl
more harm than good, for she was so frightened by
the lady’s cold words and frigid looks, that they sent
her into shivering fits that lasted long after the ceremonious
calls were over.</p>

<p>“She is a cold-hearted, cruel woman, and makes
you worse whenever she comes. I’ll never let her in
again if you’ll give me leave to keep her out, my dear!”
exclaimed the indignant maid.</p>

<p>But Molly cried out in terror that not for worlds
would she treat Cecil’s mother with such indignity.</p>

<p>“I can not blame her for being angry with me. I
deserve it all for my treachery and it is very good of
her to stay here, as you say she does, to keep my
secret from the world,” she sighed, in sad humility
and remorse. “So let her come when she will, Phebe,
and never tell her how her cold looks frighten me and
make me worse.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>
</div>


<p>Mrs. Laurens was not a hard woman, but she could
not help being very angry with the girl who had deceived
her son, and she felt, although she would not
have openly admitted it, that she would not be sorry if
the accident that the physician was trying to prevent
should happen.</p>

<p>“Cecil would not have to take her back to spoil his
life further,” she said to herself, and no pity came to
her for the girl whose young life was spoiled also by
the sin into which her love had led her.</p>

<p>Anger and resentment were too strong to admit
sweet pity into her breast.</p>

<p>“I must not wish that she should die, yet that would
be the best thing that could happen for her and for us
all,” she thought more than once.</p>

<p>So it happened that she took no part in nursing the
invalid beyond the mere cold duty calls she made
morning and night for the sake of appearances.</p>

<p>But the accident for which she could not help hoping
did not occur, owing to the care of the physician,
and the good nursing of Phebe. Molly began to get
gradually better and to look with hollow, restless orbs
for the return of the proud, angry husband who had
repudiated and forsaken her when he discovered her
treachery.</p>

<p>“Will he never come again, Phebe?” she would
moan restlessly when two weeks had passed and
neither Doctor Charley nor his brother had returned to
London.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span></p>

<p>“Doctor Laurens will be sure to bring him as soon
as he finds him. Try to be patient, dearie,” Phebe
would reply, tenderly, but Molly would sob hopelessly,
believing that fate had done its worst for her, and
that Cecil would never return.</p>

<p>“I can never tell Lady Madelon and her parents the
truth now. They would be ashamed of me, they
would not acknowledge me,” she thought, with bitter
pain, and when Lady Trueheart and her daughter
who in common with the rest of the world were ignorant
of the tragedy at The Acacias, called to see their
young favorite, Molly was so silent and <i>distrait</i> that
they thought her even sicker than she was, and went
away with the gravest apprehension for her life.</p>

<p>Three weeks passed, and Molly was well enough to
sit up in her easy-chair, well enough to walk from her
bed to the window, but no tidings came from Cecil,
nothing but the invariable note that Charley sent
every few days, saying simply:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>I am following on his trail, but I have not found
him yet!</i>”</p>
</div>

<p>Oh, that cruel suspense; how it fretted Molly’s
heart and nerves; how it maddened her with misery!</p>

<p>“Gracious Heaven! am I not atoning tenfold for
my folly?” she sighed over and over in those weary
weeks, each one of which seemed longer than a year.</p>

<p>In those days of suspense, illness, and despair, the
girl became only a wan shadow of the lovely madcap
who had won Cecil Laurens in spite of himself, and
made him for almost a year the happiest of men.</p>

<p>The soft hue of happiness faded from her face that
had lost all its pretty dimples and childish plumpness;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
the sweet lips took on an anguished droop, and the
plaintive sorrow in the hollow dark eyes was enough
to move the hardest heart.</p>

<p>Every day she had a long, hard, hysterical spell of
weeping in Phebe’s arms, and the maid declared afterward
that these bitter sobs and tears had saved her
young mistress from madness or death from a broken
heart.</p>

<p>“They kind of relieve her feelings, those tears,” she
said, knowingly.</p>

<p>And if she had been as cultured as she was wise,
she would have exclaimed with the poet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Benign restorer of the soul!</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">Whoever fliest to bring relief,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">When first we feel the rude control</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">Of love or pity, joy or grief!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Molly did not know that those tears were saving her,
for it seemed as if her heart would burst when she
shed them on Phebe’s motherly breast. But they relieved
her pent-up agony all the same, and made her
calmer and more patient for the rest of each long
weary day as it glided slowly into the irrevocable past.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>
</div>


<p>It seemed to Molly as if she should never see Cecil
again, as if in spite of all Doctor Charley’s hopes he
would never return to her who had deceived him. A
bitter pride began to stir in her heart.</p>

<p>“I have no right here. I ought to have gone with
Louise when she told me,” she said to herself, sadly,
for her sensitive pride would not permit her to discuss
her situation with Phebe, although she felt certain that
the maid knew all.</p>

<p>But one day she became aware that there was a sudden
stir and confusion in the house as of a sudden arrival.
Her heart leaped wildly.</p>

<p>“It is Cecil!” she exclaimed, gladly, and her first impulse
was to leave the room in search of him; but the
thought of Mrs. Laurens’ cold eyes and scornful lips
drove her back with her feet upon the threshold.</p>

<p>“I must wait. He will come to me here,” she murmured,
sinking back into her chair and trembling with
joyful agitation.</p>

<p>Phebe hurried in presently with a beaming face.</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear, your husband is come!” she exclaimed,
joyfully.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know—my heart told me,” said the eager
girl. “Oh, Phebe, how soon shall I see him? Will he
come to me here?”</p>

<p>“Of course, my pet. But try to be patient, Mrs.
Laurens. He is with his father and mother now.”</p>

<p>“I ought to be first!” Molly cried, with kindling
cheeks, then the flush faded quickly as it had come,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
and she murmured, plaintively: “but I can not expect
that now. I must be content with the slightest
favors. I shall be thankful only to see him once again.”</p>

<p>She looked wistfully at Phebe.</p>

<p>“Am I very thin? Do I look very ill?” she asked,
anxiously.</p>

<p>“Do not bother about your looks, my dear. No one
could expect you to look well in your condition and
after such an illness,” the maid cried, soothingly.</p>

<p>“But I must not look ugly in Cecil’s eyes. He used
to think me so pretty. Oh, Phebe, can’t you fix me a
little so that I shall not look so ill? And draw the
curtains, and soften the light. It shines too brightly
on my faded face.”</p>

<p>Phebe humored her as if she had been a sick child.
She dropped the heavy curtains of silk and lace between
the girl’s face and the too garish light of day.
Then she brought from the dressing-room a rose-pink
wrapper trimmed with soft swan’s-down and pink
satin ribbons. When Molly was dressed in this, and
her curly hair arranged in a pretty, careless, fluffy
fashion, she looked lovely in spite of her illness and
delicate pallor.</p>

<p>“You are pretty enough now to win his love over
again,” declared Phebe, fondly. “Now sit here quietly
in this chair, and wait for him patiently until he
comes.”</p>

<p>“Did he say he would come soon, Phebe?”</p>

<p>“He did not speak to me, my dear. I only saw him
come in at the door with his brother, and they went
into the parlor with their parents. But of course,
when they tell him how sick you have been, he will
hasten to you.”</p>

<p>Molly did not answer, only sat with wide-open dark<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
eyes fixed on the closed door. An excited color glowed
on her cheeks, and her parted lips emitted quick, almost
sobbing, breaths. To herself she was saying,
feverishly:</p>

<p>“I will throw myself at his feet and tell him everything.
He will see that Louise was as much to blame
as I was, and he can not refuse to forgive me. If he
does, I shall die!”</p>

<p>She looked around with her wistful, fever-bright
eyes at Phebe.</p>

<p>“I’m not impatient,” she said, plaintively; “but he
is so long in coming! It is more than an hour.”</p>

<p>“Only fifteen minutes by the clock since he entered
the house, dear Mrs. Laurens,” answered Phebe, glancing
at the pretty little Swiss affair on the mantel that
told off the fleeting hours.</p>

<p>A muffled step sounded on the thick hall carpet outside.
It paused, and a gentle hand rapped on the door.
Molly’s mobile face grew radiant with love, hope, and
joy.</p>

<p>“Cecil!” she murmured, in a thrilling voice, and
Phebe moved to the door and threw it wide open.</p>

<p>“Come in,” she said, and there entered Doctor Laurens!</p>

<p>There was no one behind him, for he closed the door
and crossed over to the side of the waiting girl.</p>

</div>


<p>“Sister,” he said, gently, bending down and lifting
her wasted little hand to his lips.</p>

<p>She let him kiss it in dead silence. Her face had
grown ashy white, the light had faded from her eyes,
the color from her lips.</p>

<p>“Sister,” he repeated again, holding her hand and
looking anxiously into her changed face; but Molly’s
lips moved nervously without giving forth a sound.</p>

<p>“Doctor Laurens, she’s disappointed. She thought
you would bring her husband,” Phebe said, bluntly.</p>

<p>“I did. I thought she <i>knew</i>,” he replied, in surprise;
and he continued, tenderly; “Yes, I have
brought him back to you, little girl, after a hard chase,
and may the Lord deliver me from ever again having
to follow a man who has run away from his own misery.
Jove! but he gave me a run, although I captured
him at last, on one of the coldest peaks of Switzerland.”</p>

<p>Phebe rejoined, impatiently:</p>

<p>“I have told her he was in the house, Doctor Laurens,
but she was waiting for him to come to her here—in
this room, you understand.”</p>

<p>He understood, for his face changed and clouded.
He said, in an embarrassed tone:</p>

<p>“Ah!”</p>

<p>Molly seemed to recover speech. She faltered, anxiously:</p>

<p>“I long to see him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span></p>

<p>“Poor child!” exclaimed Doctor Charley, with ready
sympathy. He hesitated a moment, then said, gently:
“Try to be patient a little longer, my dear. He is apt
to be a little hard when he is vexed and hurt; but—”</p>

<p>She interrupted him with a piercing cry.</p>

<p>“Do you mean that he will not forgive me—that he
has no pity for me?”</p>

<p>“Gently, sister!” said Doctor Charley, full of sympathy
for the forlorn young creature. “Listen, now,
and do not interrupt me. Cecil is angry still, but he
has come back to repair the wrong caused by your ignorance
in wedding him under a false name. He will
make you his wife again by a private ceremony here
in this room tomorrow.”</p>

<p>“Oh, may Heaven bless him for that noble deed! I
knew he could not desert me like that, when he
learned all. Oh, Doctor Charley, bring him to me; I
have so much to say to him!” Molly exclaimed, full
of eager joy and hope.</p>

<p>He shook his head, and said, sadly enough:</p>

<p>“It is quite useless, my dear little sister, to ask me
to bring him, for he has refused to come. He is angry
still, as I told you, and he will not see you until the
hour of the ceremony that makes you again his wife!”</p>

<p>She stared at him aghast, the momentary hopefulness
fading from her face.</p>

<p>“Do not look at me like that—I could not move
him!” he said, imploringly. “Come, be reasonable, my
child. You did not expect him to forgive you all at
once, did you?”</p>

<p>“No,” she faltered.</p>

<p>“And you were right,” he answered, reluctant to
pain her, but knowing that her heart must be probed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
still further ere it might be healed. “Cecil is very
proud, you know, and he finds it hard to forgive your
deceit. He thinks he is only to marry you again for
the sake of the child that is coming to bear his name,
but I am sure that underneath the crust of his anger
and resentment his love for you lives yet.”</p>

<p>Her head drooped sadly to her breast, and she sighed
heavily while he continued:</p>

<p>“It must be your task, my sister, to win this
wounded heart back to you. Cecil is hard and proud,
but he is just. When he sees your remorse and repentance
he will be sorry for you, he will pity you, and
with the coming of your child the cloud will pass from
your lives, and you will be happy again.”</p>

<p>He spoke more sanguinely than he had cause to
speak, but he believed that unless he could whisper
some hope and comfort to that crushed heart, it must
break beneath the weight of its shame and sorrow.
And he was right, for as he ceased speaking she lifted
her bowed head, and said, with a faint, wavering
smile:</p>

<p>“God bless you for your prophecy, my noble
brother! Ah, if the deepest devotion woman ever felt
can melt his proud heart, I will lay that devotion at
his feet and plead with him for pardon and love.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>
</div>


<p>If Cecil had been angry with his wife when he first
entered the house, his interview with his mother did
not tend to lessen his resentment.</p>

<p>She told him at once the story she had heard from
Louise Barry relative to her summary ejectment from
the house.</p>

<p>“Did you hear of anything so low, so ill-bred?” she
exclaimed.</p>

<p>And the fastidious Cecil shuddered.</p>

<p>“And to think that this ill-natured, treacherous
creature was your wife—will be your wife again! Oh,
Cecil, is it necessary, do you think, this sacrifice of
yourself?”</p>

<p>“Mother!”</p>

<p>That word and the stern glance of his proud blue
eyes made her quail.</p>

<p>He looked wan, wasted, wretched. She had never
seen her handsome Cecil look so ill, and it made her
wrath all the more bitter against her who had caused
it, but she dared say no more, for he went on, rebukingly:</p>

<p>“I hardly expected this from you, my mother. Say
that she deserves no mercy for her treachery to poor
John Keith and to me, and I will agree with you; but
you must be aware—Charley says he told you—that
there is another question involved now—a point of
honor.”</p>

<p>“Unfortunately, yes,” she answered, sighing.</p>

<p>He went on, with grave seriousness:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span></p>

<p>“The little one that is coming to me had no part in
the sin of its ignorant young mother, and should not
bear the consequences of her treachery. Neither would
it be right that a shadow should rest on the mother that
the world might visit on the child. Therefore, it is
best that I should go through another ceremony with
her, to make all things secure for honor’s sake.”</p>

<p>“You will live with her again?”</p>

<p>With a slight flush he answered:</p>

<p>“Nominally, yes. That is to say, she will be an inmate
of my home, and I shall treat her with respect
before my household and before the world. But, beyond
that, we shall be as utter strangers.”</p>

<p>“She ought to be thankful for even that grace. Few
would have granted so much, but the honor of the
Laurens is above everything else. Still, it will be a
hard life for you, my son.”</p>

<p>“If I can not endure it, I will travel,” he replied.</p>

<p>“You will be an exile for the sake of that girl, your
life spoiled, your heart empty—oh, it is cruel!” she
exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Do not pity me, mother, I can not bear it!” he said,
hastily, then rising: “I think I must get Charley and
go out as we have to make arrangements for that private
ceremony in the morning. Of course you know it
must be managed so that it may never come to the
world’s ears?”</p>

<p>“I know. I will see to all that, but I think you had
better ask the Barrys to be present,” she said.</p>

<p>“I will ask them,” he replied.</p>

<p>The door opened, admitting Doctor Charley.</p>

<p>“I am ready to go with you, Cecil, to see about the
license and the minister.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” then with inexpressible bitterness:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
“Let us be quite sure to have the right name this
time.”</p>

<p>“All right. I asked her and she wrote it down for
me here,” handing Cecil a card on which he read in a
familiar chirography that made his heart throb
fiercely, the simple name:</p>

<p>“Mary Ernestine Trueheart.”</p>

<p>Charley continued, kindly:</p>

<p>“Her age is about eighteen. She could not have
been much more than a child when you first saw her,
Cecil?”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Barry said she was five-and-twenty,” he replied,
and there flashed over him a remembrance of the
times when Molly had declared she was not yet seventeen.</p>

<p>“She almost betrayed herself, then,” he thought, but
he said nothing more to his brother, only when they
were leaving the house.</p>

<p>“We will call on the Barrys,” he said. “Mother
thinks they should be present at the ceremony tomorrow.”</p>

<p>“I do not think Lou—I mean Molly—would like it,
Cecil,” Doctor Charley said, quickly, but his brother
answered, morosely:</p>

<p>“It does not matter. We are not arranging the
ceremony to please <i>her</i>, Charley.”</p>

<p>“But why humiliate her further? She is wretched
enough already.”</p>

<p>“Not half so wretched as I am,” Cecil answered,
with sudden sharp anger.</p>

<p>Doctor Charley could be obstinate, too, although he
was so much sweeter-tempered than his brother.</p>

<p>“Very well, ask the Barrys if you like, but I am not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
going with you to call on them,” he replied quietly.</p>

<p>Cecil resented the refusal.</p>

<p>“By Jove, Charley, you go too far in taking her
part,” he said sharply. “You seem to forget that Mrs.
Barry and the niece are the wronged ones.”</p>

<p>“I forget nothing,” said Doctor Charley sturdily.
“But I think that if the Barrys had been good, true-hearted
women, they would not have crossed the seas
to hunt down a poor girl who had committed a fault
through love, that no intermeddling of theirs could
set straight. Much better have let it all alone.”</p>

<p>Cecil stared at him in surprise and displeasure.</p>

<p>“I must have found it out sometime—when I went
home if not sooner,” he said.</p>

<p>“Poor Molly would never have let you find it out—women
are so clever—but they took her by surprise,”
Doctor Charley returned.</p>

<p>“I wanted to know if there was anything wrong!
I do not fancy being deceived,” sternly.</p>

<p>Doctor Charley looked almost contemptuously.</p>

<p>“So you thank the Barrys for your misery,” he said
dryly. “Very well, call on them by all means then, and
thank them for their friendship, in having put asunder
what God had joined together. Perhaps things will
come out so that you will get the real Louise Barry for
your wife at last. I have no doubt that old woman
and her niece will help you to torture poor Molly into
an early grave.”</p>

<p>“Charley?” rebukingly.</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“What have I done that you should be so hard on
me in my trouble?”</p>

<p>“You have turned against the woman you swore to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
love, honor and protect, and you have earned my contempt
by your weakness,” fearlessly. “What is there
in a name that you should hate her so? She is the
same girl you loved and married, call her by what
name you will!”</p>

</div>


<p>It was a strange bridal there in that quiet room
where Molly had lain so many weary days and nights
ill and suffering—a strange bridal, compared with the
one in which the same two had been the principal
actors less than a year before.</p>

<p>Then the man had been proud, smiling, happy, looking
forward to a bright future; the bride had been
lovely and radiant outwardly, whatever might have
been her secret terrors at her hidden treachery.</p>

<p>But now all was changed. When the bridegroom
entered with cold, averted eyes and a pale, stern,
haughty countenance, following his brother, parents,
the Barrys, and the minister, there rose to join him
before the holy man of God a slight, drooping figure
that had been crouching forlornly all the morning in
an easy-chair, with the pale face bowed in its hands.</p>

<p>Cecil gave her a cold, slight, disdainful bow that
chilled her to the heart, and made her shrink back
sensitively against Doctor Charley, who had assisted
her to rise from her chair. The young doctor whispered,
hurriedly:</p>

<p>“Never mind his coldness now. You can soon win
him back.”</p>

<p>He drew her forward and placed her trembling hand
on Cecil’s arm. She stood there quivering with emotion,
not daring to look up, afraid of the cold, angry
faces around.</p>

<p>The good minister had been told a simple, plausible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
tale; some slight illegality had been detected in the
marriage, and the principals had determined to have
another ceremony to make all secure. There was
nothing strange in it at all, and he did not wonder that
the parties were sensitive over the matter, and desired
to keep it secret. What he did wonder at was the
cold, stern face of the handsome groom, and the ill
and frightened looks of the pallid bride. But he did
not possess the clew to these strange looks, and he was
ushered out so quickly after he read the ceremony and
pronounced the prayers, that he could not see whether
any good wishes were offered or not. Cecil and
Charley went out with him, and all the rest followed,
except the bride and the alert Phebe, and Louise
Barry, who had stayed behind to whisper, vindictively:</p>

<p>“So you have got him again by your cunning!
Well, remember what I told you. If you betray <i>me</i>, if
you breathe one word to defend yourself I swear I
will compass your <i>death</i>!”</p>

<p>Phebe pushed in between them.</p>

<p>“Go away, Miss Barry, and leave her alone, or I
shall tell her husband how you have treated her,” she
threatened.</p>

<p>Louise gave her a wicked glance.</p>

<p>“Tell him—but it will be at <i>her</i> peril,” she said,
menacingly, as she trailed her rich garments through
the door-way.</p>

<p>Phebe slammed the door and turned to her mistress,
who had fallen down wearily on a sofa.</p>

<p>“I shall tell Mr. Cecil of this woman’s wicked treatment
of you,” she exclaimed; but Molly held up a
warning hand.</p>

<p>“No, no, you will not tell him,” she said. “I—I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
not afraid of Louise. Oh, Phebe!” with sudden, irrepressible
anguish, “is he not going to speak to me, is
he going away from me like this?”</p>

<p>Phebe thought she had never seen such a terrible
fear and dread as looked at her from Molly’s large,
lustrous eyes that looked so big and bright in her
small, pale face. Tears came into her own.</p>

<p>“He will come back directly, dear, I’m sure,” she
said; but not being so sure as she pretended, she
whisked out of the room in a hurry.</p>

<p>She saw Doctor Charley going away with the minister,
and poking her head audaciously into the parlor,
beheld Cecil Laurens the center of a condoling
group, Miss Barry being close at his elbow.</p>

<p>“Mr. Laurens, your wife wants to see you,” she
said, abruptly.</p>

<p>He started and frowned; but with the perfect courtesy
of which he was master, disengaged himself from
the group and came toward her, saying in a low voice:</p>

<p>“Can you not bring me her message, Phebe?”</p>

<p>“No, sir!” in such a curt, dry tone that he flushed
to his temples, pushed angrily past her, and returned
to the room where he had left his sad little bride without
a word or look.</p>

<p>He had to look at her now, and angry as he was he
started in surprise at the change her weeks of illness
and grief had wrought.</p>

<p>There was in her dress and air no attempt at wedding
bravery. She wore a quiet, silver-gray silk, with
ribbons of the same sober hue that gave her a demure,
Quaker-like appearance. He had seen her in the same
dress before when her vivid face had lighted it up into
beauty, but now her thinness, her pallor, her expression<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
of humility and misery combined, was actually
painful to behold.</p>

<p>He stopped in front of her, and her haggard face
lighted up with something like hope.</p>

<p>“You sent for me?” he said, icily.</p>

<p>And she faltered, humbly:</p>

<p>“I wanted to—to—thank you, Cecil, for—for—your—kindness
to me in—in repairing the—the—”</p>

<p>The faltering voice broke down entirely, choked by
sobs. Molly’s face dropped into her hands, and tears
fell through her fingers.</p>

<p>Cecil Laurens stood regarding her in silence, apparently
unmoved by her passionate emotion.</p>

<p>He thought, angrily:</p>

<p>“She is trying to move me by the arts of the actress
inherited from her low mother, but she will not succeed.”</p>

<p>But it was not comfortable to watch those tears,
even while he believed them feigned.</p>

<p>He moved restlessly, and spoke:</p>

<p>“It was not worth your while to thank me, for you
must be aware that it was not for your own sake that
I made the sacrifice of an hour ago, but only that the
honor of the Laurens family might remain untarnished.”</p>

<p>She murmured, brokenly, through her tears:</p>

<p>“Yes, I know. Your brother told me. But—since
you disdain thanks from me—let me thank you in the
name of my unborn child for the mercy you have had
on us both! Oh, Cecil, husband,” rising in a gust of
passion and falling down humbly at his feet, “will you
not let me tell you all my story; how I was tempted,
how I fell into error? I am not so wicked as you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
think me. I—I—oh, Heaven! he has gone without a
glance or a single kind word!” for he had turned deliberately
and left the room.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII.</h2>
</div>


<p>Blinded by passion, indignant that Molly should
have the hardihood to attempt any defense of her
treachery, Cecil Laurens had turned a deaf ear to her
pleadings and hurried from the room.</p>

<p>But he did not go back to the conclave in the parlor.
He hurried along the hall to the room he had occupied
in solitude last night, entered and locked the door.</p>

<p>Moved and agitated in spite of his strong self-will,
he walked restlessly up and down the floor.</p>

<p>“The girl must be mad to think I could pardon her
sin,” he exclaimed. “Great heavens, when I think that
she belonged to John Keith when she went through
that farce of a marriage with me, I go mad with rage!
But for that—but for the deep treachery of that falsehood
to him and to me, I believe I could have forgiven
all the rest, for I am sure she loved me! But, oh,
God, to think of one so young, so lovely, so apparently
innocent, yet steeped to the lips in duplicity! How
did she have the heart to abandon him and to deceive
me as she did? I can not forgive her, even though
she pleads that it was love for me that tempted her!
And after all was it love? I must remember that John
Keith was very poor and I was very rich. She may
have deserted him for the sake of gold.”</p>

<p>The suspicion maddened him. He flung himself
down before his writing-desk, caught up the pen and
wrote recklessly:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Madame</span>,—I neither desire nor will accept any
explanation or excuse for your treachery. The reasons,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
alas, are all too plain. I was rich, John Keith
was poor, so you threw him over for me! You see I
understand it all, and nothing you can say or do can
palliate your horrible treachery! I despise you, and
although I have today for honor’s sake given you the
shelter of my name, we shall never more be husband
and wife save in name. Even in the same house I shall
live apart from you, never seeing you when I can avoid
it, never speaking to you unless it is forced upon me,
although the world outside must never dream of our
secret alienations. The money you sinned for you still
shall have, but my respect and love never again! You
understand that this is final. I will listen to no appeals.
If you speak to me I will turn from you, if you
write to me I will return your letters unread. I will
not even listen to any one who speaks to me in your
behalf. I hold your sin and folly as past all forgiveness.</p>

<p class="right right-indent">
“<span class="smcap">Cecil Laurens.</span>”<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>He did not even read it over, so fierce was his anger,
so impatient his mood. Thrusting it hastily into an
envelope he wrote upon the back her name, “Mrs.
Cecil Laurens.”</p>

<p>Taking the unsealed letter in his hand he went along
the hall and tapped at the door of her room.</p>

<p>Phebe responded to his light knock. As the door
flew open he saw Molly lying on her bed with her delicate
hands before her face.</p>

<p>“This is for your mistress,” he said, thrusting the
letter into the hand of the maid, and turning away
hastily, but not so fast that he saw his wife spring
upright, eagerly, to receive the missive. The door
closed quickly on him and he went back to the parlor
with a strangely heavy heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span></p>

<p>The little group of women started guiltily at his entrance,
and he knew by their looks that they had been
discussing him and his troubles; but no one said a
word, only Louise Barry gave him a look of silent
sympathy from her golden eyes that spoke volumes.</p>

<p>“What a stately beauty she is,” he thought, and suddenly
remembered all that Molly had told him of her
step-sister’s strange beauty.</p>

<p>“She <i>is</i> handsome; but her eyes with their strange
yellow gleams make one think of a tigress,” he mused,
and then he asked himself, soberly:</p>

<p>“If this one had come to Ferndale instead of that
misguided girl could I have loved her as I loved that
little enchantress?”</p>

<p>It almost seemed to him like a wrong to that handsome,
high-born beauty when his heart impetuously
answered no.</p>

<p>There came to him a memory of what his brother
had said yesterday:</p>

<p>“What is there in a name that you should hate her
so? She is the same girl you loved and married, call
her by what name you will.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV">CHAPTER XXXIV.</h2>
</div>


<p>Miss Barry’s voice recalled him to the present. She
was persuading his mother to share their opera-box
that night.</p>

<p>“I should not like to leave Cecil. He will like for
me to be at home with him perhaps,” Mrs. Laurens
replied.</p>

<p>“Oh, he will come, too—will you not, Mr. Laurens?”
turning the radiant eyes persuasively on his
face.</p>

<p>“Do, Cecil, you will enjoy the music,” said his
mother.</p>

<p>“And I want you to come, Cecil, very much,” added
old Mrs. Barry.</p>

<p>“Very well, I will,” he replied, carelessly, thinking
that it mattered little where he went since the door of
love and happiness was shut upon him forever by his
wife’s treachery.</p>

<p>Doctor Charley came in presently and found them
all discussing the opera with great animation. He was
disgusted when he heard that Cecil was going and
refused Louise’s invitation to himself point-blank.</p>

<p>“I am obliged to return to Paris tonight,” he said,
curtly, “and if I were not I am too tired. Besides, I
should not think it in good taste to go.”</p>

<p>Cecil colored and looked at him keenly.</p>

<p>“Why not?” he asked, brusquely, and Doctor Charley
answered, reproachfully:</p>

<p>“I should not forget as you and my mother seem to
do, that your young wife is ill and lonely. I should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
stay here if I had time and amuse the unhappy little
creature.”</p>

<p>Cecil’s eyes flashed angrily, and Mrs. Laurens tossed
her head in displeasure.</p>

<p>“She is well enough, only sulky,” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>Miss Barry laughed, easily.</p>

<p>“Ah, I see that you understand Molly thoroughly,”
she said. “Her sulky fits used to be the bane of her
mother as long as she lived, and of Aunt Lucy and
myself after my step-mother’s death. She will do
worse if you notice them, but if left to herself will
become sensible after awhile.”</p>

<p>Doctor Charley gave her a keen look of displeasure
which she pretended not to observe.</p>

<p>“I do not like you, Miss Cat-eyes,” he said to himself.
“For all poor Molly’s treachery she is more lovable
than you, and perhaps you have made the case
worse than it really is. Some day when Molly gets
well she shall tell me the whole story, but not now, for
it would agitate her too much and that would be
dangerous in her condition.”</p>

<p>He rose impatiently and left the room. Cecil looked
after him angrily, knowing well that he was going
straight to Molly.</p>

<p>“Confound the fellow! What has come over him to
meddle like this in my affairs?” he thought.</p>

<p>Phebe opened the door gladly enough at his knock.
She was getting worried over Molly, who had refused
to speak one word since she had read that letter
written in the height of Cecil’s resentful passion.</p>

<p>She was sitting, or rather, crouched, in a forlorn
attitude upon the bed, her arms clasped around her
knees, her curly hair falling in disheveled masses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
round her face and neck, her eyes staring gloomily
into vacancy, her face pale and drawn with despair.</p>

<p>Doctor Charley went up and spoke to her, but she
did not answer nor look at him any more than if she
had been a statue.</p>

<p>“What is it, Phebe?” he asked, distressedly, and the
maid answered:</p>

<p>“Mr. Cecil handed me a letter to give her, and she’s
been like that ever since she read it.”</p>

<p>He saw then that her hands were shut tight over a
crushed letter, and tried gently to take it away, but she
clung to it with convulsive strength.</p>

<p>Charley did not relish deceit and duplicity any better
than Cecil did, and in his heart he knew that the
girl had done wrong; but her trouble, her grief, her
sad situation had aroused all the chivalry in his nature,
and, profoundly moved, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Do not look so wretched, little sister. You are not
quite friendless while Phebe and I are left to you.
Come turn your eyes on mine, dear, and tell me what
they have done to grieve you so.”</p>

<p>As if touched to the heart by his loving tone, Molly
flashed her eyes upon his with a world of passion in
them, and, opening wide her little hand, flung the
letter at his feet.</p>

<p>“There, take it—your brother’s wedding gift to
me;” she cried in concentrated scorn, bitterness, and
anguish.</p>

<p>He knew that she meant him to read it, and after
he had done so he stood silent before her dumbly questioning
eyes knowing not what to say.</p>

<p>“Well,” she said, at last, and laughed low and
strangely—so strangely that it chilled his blood, “well,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
Doctor Charley, what do you say about winning him
back now?”</p>

<p>The words roused him into action. He shook himself
free from the indignant silence in which he had
been contemplating his brother’s cruelty, and coming
close to her took both her hands in his.</p>

<p>He knew that he must put some hope into that agonized
young heart or she would die or go mad of this
awful shock. In that low, strange laugh had sounded
the echo of incipient madness.</p>

<p>“My brother was cruel, very cruel, I can not deny
that, dear Molly,” he said, sadly, feeling ashamed of
Cecil for his hardness when the girl was so low and ill.</p>

<p>She clung to him like a child, and said, in a strained
whisper:</p>

<p>“You see I sent Phebe to bring him to me. I wanted
to explain—all. He would not listen—he went away—and
sent me <i>that</i>!” her eye indicating the letter with a
glance of infinite loathing.</p>

<p>“I shall burn this, and you must forget it,” he said,
decisively; but she answered:</p>

<p>“Burn it if you will. The words are engraven on
my heart!”</p>

<p>Very gravely and tenderly he said:</p>

<p>“Try to forget it, Molly, for Cecil will be ashamed
soon that he wrote such cruel words to you. Do as I
told you, dear. Try to win him back in spite of coldness,
in spite of neglect. These will not last, for Cecil
can not succeed in putting you from his heart, and in
a few short months you will have a claim on him that
he can not deny and that <i>must</i> break down every barrier
of his pride.”</p>

<p>She hid her face against his sleeve, and whispered:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span></p>

<p>“I shall pray Heaven to let me die when my hour of
trial comes, for if I lived he would hate my child for
its mother’s sake.”</p>

<p>Wisely and gravely he tried to dissuade her from
such wild prayers, preached love and patience to the
sore heart until he won her promise that she would
still try in spite of scorn and rebuffs to win Cecil back.
Then he left her calmed and quieted, and went out to
make preparations for his return that night to Paris.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXV">CHAPTER XXXV.</h2>
</div>


<p>When he came back several hours later to bid her
farewell she was lying quiet with her eyes shut.
Phebe whispered cautiously:</p>

<p>“She is asleep!”</p>

<p>The dark eyes opened quickly.</p>

<p>“I am not asleep. I was only thinking,” she said.</p>

<p>Then she met her brother-in-law’s kind eyes fixed
on her full of pity.</p>

<p>She drew him down to her and whispered:</p>

<p>“I have been thinking of what I promised you, but
I’m afraid it will be useless to try, for how can I win
him back if I never see him?”</p>

<p>“You must see him,” Doctor Charley replied firmly.</p>

<p>“But how? I can not send for him again, and he
will not come of his own will.”</p>

<p>“That is true. But, Molly—how strange it sounds
to call you Molly! You must get strong enough to go
out of this room, to meet your husband at the table,
and in the parlor daily. You must accept invitations
to places where he will be compelled to attend you.
Gradually you will win him back to his old attendance
on you, his old loving care. Then the rest will be
easy.”</p>

<p>“I will try, oh, so hard,” she said, and deeply moved,
he pressed the little nervous hand.</p>

<p>“When you get stronger you will write to me and
tell me how you get on with your labor of love,” he
said. “And now, little sister, I must bid you adieu, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
must return to Paris tonight, having missed all the
lectures during the weeks I have been chasing that
runaway Cecil.”</p>

<p>“God bless you for all your goodness to me,” she
whispered, and he went away with those grateful
words ringing like music in his ears.</p>

<p>She turned wistfully to Phebe.</p>

<p>“Do you not think I am strong enough to go into the
parlor tonight?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed, that you are not!” replied the maid decidedly,
and after a minute she added with a snort of
displeasure, “besides there would be no use. I heard
Mrs. Laurens’ maid saying just now that her mistress
and Mr. Cecil were going to the opera with the Barrys.
I’ll tell you one thing, Mrs. Laurens. That yellow-eyed
deceitful woman is going to take your husband
from you if she can!”</p>

<p>“She can not do that, for he is bound to me,” Molly
exclaimed, but the warning never left her thoughts, for
she knew that Louise would try to widen the gulf
between her and Cecil until it should become impassable.</p>

<p>“It will be so easy to do that,” she thought, bitterly.
“Ah, Doctor Charley’s words were but sophistry. He
will not let me win him back. Perhaps already his
thoughts have gone after beautiful Louise.”</p>

<p>Tortured by such thoughts as these it was no wonder
that her strength came back so slowly that Phebe
would not consent to her leaving the room for more
than a week.</p>

<p>Indeed the maid would have liked to keep her mistress
from mingling at all with the rest of the family,
for she knew that her orders to the footman had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
countermanded by Cecil, and that the Barrys were frequent
and honored guests at The Acacias.</p>

<p>Phebe knew another thing that made her uneasy for
the sake of her forlorn young mistress.</p>

<p>There was a conspiracy afoot to discharge her by
way of punishment for what was deemed her impertinence
to Miss Barry. Phebe had heard the rumor, but
she kept silence, hoping that her young mistress would
insist on retaining her for her own sake.</p>

<p>About ten days after that marriage ceremony in the
invalid’s chamber Molly declared that she was well
enough to go out of her room and that she should
breakfast with the family that morning.</p>

<p>Phebe gave a ready assent to the plan and dressed
her very tastefully, taking pains to bring out every one
of her young mistress’ beauties by her well-chosen
morning dress.</p>

<p>Then she led her herself to the dining-room, fearful
that her agitation might make her faint by the way.</p>

<p>Mr. Laurens, his wife and son were already in the
room. They looked up in surprise at Molly’s entrance.</p>

<p>Poor Molly, poor trembling little culprit! She
would have given worlds for one kind look from her
husband’s eyes. She turned an imploring glance on
his cold face, but he met it with one of surprise and
displeasure, supplemented by a slight bow, then let
her take her seat at the table without further notice.</p>

<p>Her mother-in-law made a curt inquiry after her
health, and her father-in-law supplemented it by a
careless “Good-morning.”</p>

<p>Evidently her presence was unexpected and undesired
by the small family.</p>

<p>The meal proceeded in embarrassing silence. Molly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
tried to eat, but it was a melancholy and mechanical
proceeding. She burned her tongue with hot coffee,
but she was afraid to cry out at the pain; she nearly
choked herself trying to swallow things that she put
into her mouth in the pretense of eating; and at last
she gave it up and sat quiet, with her eyes on her
plate, until the ordeal was over. How she groped her
way to the morning-room she scarcely knew. Cecil
had left the dining-room before her, and she followed
slowly in his train.</p>

<p>He was cutting the leaves of a book for his mother.
At Molly’s entrance he rose and placed a chair for her
with distant courtesy.</p>

<p>She thanked him and sat down, and for some moments
an embarrassing silence reigned.</p>

<p>Cecil broke it with a curt sentence that made Molly
start.</p>

<p>“You are better?” he said.</p>

<p>“Thank you, oh, yes, much better,” she faltered,
grateful for even this notice.</p>

<p>A glance at the pale, wan face did not assure him
of the fact, but he went on, pitilessly:</p>

<p>“You no longer need the care of a sick-nurse?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” she faltered again, miserably, feeling as if
he desired the negative; but she started when he exclaimed,
with curt emphasis:</p>

<p>“I am very glad to hear it.”</p>

<p>“Why?” she faltered, looking up at him, but the
handsome face was averted.</p>

<p>But he had heard the timid question, for presently
he answered, coldly:</p>

<p>“I have been trying to be patient and wait until you
were able to dispense with your maid. That impertinent
woman has to go!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span></p>

<p>“My good Phebe to leave me? Oh, I can not let
her go!” Molly cried, wildly; but Cecil answered,
relentlessly:</p>

<p>“I expected this. It does not matter to you that the
woman has been grossly impertinent to my mother and
to our friend, Miss Barry. Perhaps,” scornfully, “you
tutored her to that end.”</p>

<p>“I cannot let her go!” Molly cried, her head dropping
forlornly on her breast.</p>

<p>“She shall go! She has been rude to my mother,
and my wife, as her guest, has no right to retain a
servant distasteful to her hostess,” Cecil said, loftily.</p>

<p>She hesitated a moment, then said, desperately:</p>

<p>“Take me away, then, to a home of my own, where
none can interfere with my choice of a servant.”</p>

<p>He answered instantly, with offensive <i>hauteur</i>:</p>

<p>“Under the present circumstances, such a course
would not be agreeable!”</p>

<p>He turned away and stood at the window, with his
back to her, determined not to be moved by the sight
of the little hands writhing in and out of each other in
her lap, and the face with its expression of dumb, patient
agony, while hot tears stole from under her lashes
and dripped down her cheeks.</p>

<p>The door opened, and his proud, stately mother entered
with her graceful, gliding motion. She frowned
when she saw poor Molly sitting there with the tears
stealing down her cheeks.</p>

<p>“If you are ill, Mrs. Laurens, perhaps I had better
assist you to your room,” she said, with pointed
courtesy.</p>

<p>Molly shook her head without reply, and Cecil
turned around.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span></p>

<p>“She is not ill, mother; she is angry,” he said,
sharply.</p>

<p>“Angry?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I have been telling her that Phebe must go,
and she objects.”</p>

<p>“Objects, Cecil?” loftily. “Surely she would not
wish to retain a servant who had been rude to <i>me</i>?”</p>

<p>“She is my only friend,” Molly muttered, in a despairing
tone, and the mother-in-law rejoined, testily:</p>

<p>“I might say that you do not deserve any friends, if
I chose to speak plainly, but I do not wish to wound
you. You can not expect me to retain that woman at
The Acacias. I have secured another maid for you—a
splendid woman with a good recommendation—and
she will take Phebe’s place tomorrow.”</p>

<p>From the pale lips of the despised young wife came
a moan of remonstrance; but no one heeded it, for
Cecil had gone abruptly out of the room, and Mrs.
Laurens, after her final sentence, sat down coolly to
her book.</p>

<p>Phebe had been on the alert and knew that Cecil
had taken his hat and left the house.</p>

<p>She peered into the morning-room and saw her
young mistress in tears and her mother-in-law absorbed
in her novel.</p>

<p>Stalking boldly across the room, she said:</p>

<p>“You are tired out with coming down to breakfast,
Mrs. Laurens. Hadn’t you better come back to your
room and rest?”</p>

<p>Molly put her hand on the strong arm and went
away sobbing unheeded by the reader, who did not
turn her head to notice the departure.</p>

<p>“Now then, who has hurt you, my pet?” Phebe demanded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
when she had laid Molly down on her soft
sofa, and with bitter sobs the whole story was blurted
out, for Molly’s heart was too full to hold it.</p>

<p>“Phebe, if they send you away I shall go with you.
I will not be parted from the only friend that is left to
me,” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>Phebe stroked the pretty, dark head in silence some
minutes before she replied, gravely:</p>

<p>“No, my dear young mistress, you must not defy
your husband like that or you will never win him back.
You must give me up as he wishes you to do, and perhaps
when he sees how you obey his wishes even
against your own desire he will send for me to come
back to you soon, for I don’t think his anger can hold
out long, seeing how sweet and humble and good you
are.”</p>

<p>After a few moments she continued, sadly:</p>

<p>“I have known this for some time, Mrs. Laurens,
but I would not distress you with it. But now I will
give you one warning. Mrs. Laurens has hired a maid
for you who was selected and recommended by Miss
Louise Barry. Hush, my dear! Do not say you will
not have her, for that would anger your husband. Let
her come, but be wary and watchful. She may be a
tool in Miss Barry’s hands and may mean to do you
harm at her instigation.”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXVI">CHAPTER XXXVI.</h2>
</div>


<p>The new maid arrived the next morning and Phebe,
who had duly received her discharge from Cecil, came
in to bid her mistress good-bye.</p>

<p>She was calm and quiet, resolutely keeping back her
tears for fear that she might make the parting too
painful.</p>

<p>“You’ll keep my secret, Phebe? You will not tell
any one?” Molly implored, clinging to her in pathetic
despair.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mrs. Laurens, what do you take me for? Wild
horses should not drag a word from me without your
consent. You hurt me almost as bad as your husband
did this morning,” she said.</p>

<p>“Cecil?” Molly queried, in surprise, and Phebe answered:</p>

<p>“He asked me how much money it would take to
pay me to keep silent over all the secrets I had found
out here. It was hard to bear, Mrs. Laurens, but I
was patient. I would not anger him, for I wanted to
come back to you some time. So I told him I needed
no bribe to keep the secrets of my unhappy young
mistress—that my love for her was enough.”</p>

<p>“Dear, good Phebe!” cried Molly, lovingly, and then
she made the woman promise not to go too far away,
and to send her an address to which to write when she
should have coaxed Cecil to let her come back.</p>

<p>Phebe promised to give her address to Miss Madelon
Trueheart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span></p>

<p>“That will be best, dear, for if I sent it to The Acacias
who knows but that the new maid might keep it
from you?” she said.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Molly did not like the crafty-looking Frenchwoman
who took the place of her good Phebe, whom Cecil had
hired for her in New York, when they were starting
on their wedding-trip.</p>

<p>But Florine, as she called herself, gave her new mistress
no cause for offense. She was quiet, polite, attentive
to Molly’s lightest wants, and the most tasteful
and skillful of maids. Her intense sympathy was irksome
for she persisted in declaring that madame
looked too ill to leave her room.</p>

<p>In fact Molly made no effort at mingling with the
family for several days after that first time. The cruel
rebuff she had received chilled and disheartened her.
She shrank sensitively from another one, and so assented
passively to Florine’s advice to keep to her room.</p>

<p>During those days of tiresome seclusion she busied
herself at intervals as her strength would permit in
writing a long letter to Doctor Charley—a letter that
required many postage stamps for mailing, for Molly
wrote down the whole story of her going to Ferndale,
and all that had followed upon that visit. She wrote
eagerly, hopefully, for she believed that her brother-in-law
would force Cecil to read this explanation from
his unhappy girl-wife.</p>

<p>“He can not think so hardly of me then, when he
finds that my only sin was committed through love of
him,” she thought, hopefully, and she stole out one
night when she thought Florine was busy in the dressing-room,
and herself placed the important letter in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
box that stood ready in the hall for the family’s mail.</p>

<p>But lynx eyes watched the furtive act, and before
Molly’s excited eyes closed that night Florine had secured
the letter, and very soon it was in the hands of
Louise Barry.</p>

<p>Ah, how hopefully Molly waited for an answer—an
answer that never came, for the young doctor’s letters
to her were always intercepted as were hers to him.</p>

<p>But she was too loyal-hearted to believe that he had
forgotten her, or that he neglected to write. She said
to herself that he had never received her letter.</p>

<p>“It is some more of Louise’s treachery,” she thought.</p>

<p>For two weeks she had not ventured out of her
room, but one evening she was so restless she felt
that she could bear it no longer.</p>

<p>“Florine, you may bring out a dinner dress for me, I
shall dine with the family,” she said.</p>

<p>“Madame does not mean it—ill as she looks!” disapprovingly.</p>

<p>“I am strong enough. It is for you to obey my commands,
Florine, not to dictate to me,” Molly answered,
with sudden dignity that silenced all remonstrance.</p>

<p>Florine brought a pretty white dress and some pearls
and dressed her mistress exquisitely. Then she said,
apologetically:</p>

<p>“It was not that I did not want you to go out,
madame, but I feared it would exhaust you, dining
with company.”</p>

<p>“Is there company?” Molly asked disappointedly.</p>

<p>“The Barrys, madame.”</p>

<p>“Do they come here often, Florine?”</p>

<p>“Do you mean the Barrys, madame?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span></p>

<p>“They are here every day, or nearly so; and when
they fail to come here, Madame Laurens, your mamma,
and Monsieur Cecil, your husband, go to them. It
is fortunate for monsieur, your husband, that he has
such a dear friend as Miss Barry to amuse him while
you, madame, are sick,” smoothly.</p>

<p>Molly’s heart began to beat loudly, the angry color
to flood her cheeks.</p>

<p>“She does <i>not</i> amuse him,” she said hotly, and Florine
arched her brows in surprise.</p>

<p>“As madame wills, but I thought she would be
pleased,” she said, apologetically.</p>

<p>Molly flung herself down sighing on the sofa.</p>

<p>“I will not go down,” she said, sadly, and she owned
to herself that she was afraid of Louise.</p>

<p>She took a book and read until she was quite sure
that the late dinner was over. She, in her character of
invalid, had had her own simple meal an hour ago.</p>

<p>She called Florine from the dressing-room.</p>

<p>“Go and ask Mr. Laurens to give me some piano
music. Tell him I will not come out of my room. I
can hear quite plainly here.”</p>

<p>Florine went out and Molly sank back, sobbing
softly.</p>

<p>“He will think I am very bold, but, oh, I could not
help it. It will take him away from her side at least,
and it will make him think of me. But will he grant
my request, or treat it with disdain?”</p>

<p>Florine came back, smirking.</p>

<p>“He will do as you wish, madame.”</p>

<p>And almost immediately the soft, full strains of music
arose upon the air.</p>

<p>Molly lay back upon her sofa listening with blended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
pleasure and pain. It took her back to that first night
at Ferndale when Cecil’s wonderful music had charmed
the anger and resentment away from her heart.</p>

<p>Perhaps some such thought came to the offended
husband too. He played one after another the old
melodies he had played that night, then some later ones
that she had loved. His touch was very soft and sweet.
Perhaps the plaintive request from his neglected wife
combined with the subtle influence of the music softened
and thrilled his proud heart.</p>

<p>“This is better than going down. Oh, how kind he
was to grant my request!” the young creature sighed,
her heart swelling with passionate love and sorrow.</p>

<p>Cecil played for more than an hour, then there came
a pause.</p>

<p>“It is over. He is weary, or perhaps already repenting
of his kindness to me,” she murmured, but the
sense of his indulgence and the influence of the music
caused a new hope to spring in her heart.</p>

<p>But it was of short duration, for in a moment the
music began again, and voices rose on the air in a
duet, the tenderest of love-songs—voices that it was
not hard to distinguish as those of her husband and
Louise Barry.</p>

<p>“Oh, cruel, cruel; they have done this to wound
me!” she cried, and sobbed herself to sleep.</p>

<p>Yet she might have known that the artful Louise
was at the bottom of it all. She had begged so that he
would accompany her in that duet that he could not in
courtesy refuse.</p>

<p>Molly’s pathetic request for the music had made
Cecil think of her, as she had hoped; and it had done
more—it had softened his hard heart to some degree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span></p>

<p>That night, alone in his chamber, his thoughts turned
to her with more kindness than he had dreamed he
could ever feel for her again. Her meek acquiescence
in his hard decree of separation, her humility, her illness,
her patience rose before him in so touching and
pathetic a light, that a moisture dimmed his eyes.</p>

<p>“Poor girl! she is crushed to earth by the exposure
of her treachery,” he thought, and a great wonder at
her humility came over him. “Such a spirited little
creature, such a mad-cap, as she used to be! What has
subdued her so? Can it be the work of love—love for
me?”</p>

<p>These softened thoughts followed him until the
next morning, and something like pity began to blend
with his anger toward his unhappy wife.</p>

<p>“She is ill and lonely, and perhaps I ought to show
her some little courtesy. I will send her some new
books; she can beguile her lonely hours with them,”
he told himself, and spent an hour selecting a dozen
books on poetry, romance, travel, and kindred subjects.</p>

<p>His heart, that had been so heavy through all its
pride and resentment, felt lighter as he retraced his
steps to The Acacias. He deemed himself quite fortunate
in meeting Florine in the hall. He called to her
hastily, and gave her the large package of books.</p>

<p>“Take these to my wife, from me,” he said, in a
softened voice. “Tell her I selected them especially
for her reading, and hope she will find them interesting.”</p>

<p>Florine took the books with a courtesy. She went
slowly along the hall—very slowly. She did not mean
to deliver the books, if she could help it.</p>

<p>But, glancing in a furtive way over her shoulder, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
saw Cecil Laurens leaning against the newel, and intently
watching her progress.</p>

<p>“<i>Diable!</i> he distrusts me,” she muttered, and a
clever thought came to her. She opened the door and
went in with the books.</p>

<p>Molly looked up at her with those dark, wistful orbs
that ought to have moved even the Frenchwoman’s
wicked heart, but their plaintive sorrow did not touch
the creature that Louise had bribed with gold.</p>

<p>“Madame,” she said, smoothly, “Miss Barry has
sent you some good, Christian books to read, and hopes
they will do you good. She called to take your husband
to a morning concert, and left the books and the
message.”</p>

<p>The sorrow in the dark eyes changed to jealous
anger.</p>

<p>“Has he gone with that woman?” Molly asked.</p>

<p>“<i>Oui</i>, madame,” said Florine, with a profound courtesy;
then, smiling, “Ah, madame, what a glorious
beauty is that queenly Miss Barry! No wonder—”
She pauses.</p>

<p>Molly looked keenly at the hesitating maid.</p>

<p>“‘It is no wonder’—well, go on,” she said, sharply.</p>

<p>“I beg madame’s pardon, I meant no harm, but I
was about to say it was no wonder that Monsieur Cecil
admires Miss Barry so much,” answered Florine, deprecatingly.</p>

<p>Molly looked straight into the shifting treacherous
black eyes.</p>

<p>“Does my husband admire <i>her</i>?” she asked, in a
strange voice.</p>

<p>“La, madame, how should I know? It was but a slip
of the tongue. I only judged by appearances,” Florine
said, tossing her smart head with its cap and ribbons.</p>

<p>Molly pointed at the package of books.</p>

<p>“Take them away and put them into the fire,” she
said, furiously, her heart swelling with jealousy. “I
will have nothing to do with the books or the sender!”</p>

<p>“<i>Oui, madame</i>,” said Florine, courtesying.</p>

<p>She took up the books and went out quickly.</p>

<p>Cecil was still lingering in the hall, perhaps awaiting
some message from his wife after his overture of kindness.
Florine went up to him with a hypocritically
sorry face.</p>

<p>“Monsieur, I do not think Madame Laurens is herself
quite this morning. She told me to put the books
into the fire.”</p>

<p>Cecil stared in incredulous amazement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span></p>

<p>“Nonsense, she could not have said that,” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“<i>Mais, oui, monsieur</i>, I speak her very words. ‘Take
them away and put them into the fire, I will have nothing
to do with them or the sender,’ she said.”</p>

<p>“<i>Really</i>, Florine?”</p>

<p>“Monsieur, I swear by the saints those were
madame’s words. Ask her if you doubt me.”</p>

<p>She had such an air of truth and injured innocence
that he believed her, and his face grew so stern and
pale that she was frightened.</p>

<p>But he took the package from her hands without a
word, and carried it to his room.</p>

<p>“I will keep them here always to remind me of this
rebuff when I feel tempted again to show her any kindness,”
he said, sternly.</p>

<p>And when Molly made her appearance at dinner that
evening he was as cold as ice, merely noticing her presence
by a slight sarcastic bow.</p>

<p>The two school girls dined at home that evening by
permission of their teacher, and their eager chatter and
merry laughter filled up the pauses that would otherwise
have been so embarrassing. One of the girls, Nina
by name, was of the same age as Molly, the other one
was sixteen, and her sweet name, Dora, had been shortened
to Dot.</p>

<p>Nina and Dot were pretty, impulsive girls, warm-hearted
to a fault, and although they had been told
Molly’s story they did not resent it as did the older
members of the family. They thought and declared
that it was too “romantic for anything.”</p>

<p>When they left their father and brother over the
wine and walnuts they each slipped an arm in Molly’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
and led her to the parlor and to a sofa, where they
placed her between them.</p>

<p>“Now, let us have a real good chat,” said Dot.
“School closes next month, you know, and then we are
all going back to the United States. Dear old Maple
Shade and black mammy, I do really long to see them
again, don’t you, Nina?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed.”</p>

<p>“Are you glad we are going home, Lou—oh, I beg
pardon, I forgot,” Dot cried, tenderly, as the hot flush
mounted to Molly’s cheek.</p>

<p>“It does not matter,” the latter said, sadly, and
Nina exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Do you know I think that your middle name—Ernestine—is
beautiful? May we not call you by that? It
is softer, I think, than the other.”</p>

<p>“As you please,” Molly answered, and Mrs. Laurens
said, coldly:</p>

<p>“I think it will be a good idea, Nina. Ernestine is
a more aristocratic name. I’m glad you suggested it.”</p>

<p>Then Dot began again:</p>

<p>“Are you glad, Ernestine, that we are going home so
soon?”</p>

<p>“I did not know we were going,” she replied, faintly,
wondering if Cecil was going to send her home alone.</p>

<p>Mrs. Laurens moved a little nearer, and said, in her
usual cold tones:</p>

<p>“It is principally on your account we are going,
that your child may be born at Maple Shade, where all
the Laurens family have been born for almost a century.”</p>

<p>Cecil in entering noiselessly that moment caught the
words clearly. He could not repress a quick glance at
his wife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span></p>

<p>He saw the pale face flush to hot, burning crimson
one moment, then grow pale and sorrowful again as
she put up one hand to shield its emotion from Mrs.
Laurens’ cold eyes.</p>

<p>She was about to speak, but at that moment she
caught the inquisitive glance of his eyes and the words
died unuttered on her lips.</p>

<p>At that moment the loud ringing of the door-bell announced
visitors. In a minute more the Barrys were
announced.</p>

<p>Louise all in opera dress with diamonds on her neck
and in her hair looked radiant. Mrs. Barry in gray
satin and ostrich plumes was sulky.</p>

<p>“I shall be glad to get Louise married off my hands,”
she exclaimed, tartly. “Here I am dragged out of the
house every evening to balls and operas at my time of
life until I am nearly dead. Mrs. Laurens, I think I
shall have to ask you to chaperone my giddy niece!”</p>

<p>“Cruel Aunt Thalia!” cried Louise, affecting to take
it all as a joke.</p>

<p>Then she caught sight of Molly, and after a moment’s
hesitation sailed forward.</p>

<p>“My dear girl, and so you are well enough to be out
at last,” she exclaimed, sweetly, holding out her jeweled
hand.</p>

<p>Molly did not look at the offered hand, did not open
her lips, did not even bend her head. She was looking
at old Mrs. Barry who did indeed appear older and
grayer than ever with new lines of care and age on her
homely face.</p>

<p>The old shame and pain at deceiving the aged gentlewoman
swelled again at Molly’s heart as it had done a
year ago at Ferndale. She rose impetuously, pushed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
aside Louise with a touch of her slender hand, and
went quickly over to Mrs. Barry’s side.</p>

<p>The old lady looked up angrily, but Molly did not
shrink as she would have done at Cecil’s frown. She
stood before the grim old dame like a child that has
done wrong, and exclaimed impetuously like a child:</p>

<p>“I am sorry I deceived you, Mrs. Barry, I was sorry
all the time. Sometimes I could hardly go on with
the deceit. Won’t you please forgive me?”</p>

<p>Louise had followed her across the room. She saw
Mrs. Barry’s hard face change and soften, and gave a
gasp of terror. Then, affecting not to have noticed
Molly’s words, she exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Come, Aunt Thalia; we shall be late for the opera.
Excuse us, Molly, but we only came by to see how you
were, and as you are so much better, we must hurry.
Good-bye all;” and without ceremony she hustled Mrs.
Barry past Molly, and out of the room.</p>

<p>Molly stood gazing after them like one dazed, until
she felt a hand touch her shoulder. It was Cecil’s
father, who said, low but firmly:</p>

<p>“Sit down, child, and do not look so frightened.”</p>

<p>He pushed her gently into a chair, the same chair
that Mrs. Barry had sat in, and she remained there
quietly a moment; then, feeling their wondering, disapproving
glances burning her sensitive face, she rose
to go. She had an impression that Cecil opened the
door for her, that he stood gazing after her as she
moved down the hall. She felt the scorn of his glance
keenly.</p>

<p>“Surely I did not do wrong,” she thought. “I had
acted badly to that poor old lady, and I thought I must
ask her forgiveness; but Louise hustled her out before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
she could answer me. She does not want her to
forgive me; she does not want me to have a single
friend.”</p>

<p>She opened her door and went in, thinking sadly
that, only for her promise to Doctor Charley, she
would not try to mingle with the family again.</p>

<p>“They hate me—all of them; they will never forgive
me for being the daughter of an actress, instead of a
Barry. Perhaps if they knew that my father was Sir
Edward Trueheart’s son, they would respect me more.
But I shall not tell them. I can be proud, too; and if
they can not love me and forgive me for myself, I will
keep my pleasant secret.”</p>

<p>Florine looked at her narrowly.</p>

<p>“Madame, I can not help thinking you look worse
every time you leave your room. I am sure you are
not strong enough to bear company,” she said, with
pretended solicitude.</p>

<p>“I believe you are right, Florine,” Molly answered,
with sudden bitterness, and she resolved that she would
not go among them again as long as she could help it.</p>

<p>Florine fostered the resolve. She made Molly believe
she was sicker than she was. She excluded every one
from the room, declaring that her mistress was nervous
and could not bear company. Even the Truehearts
were, without Molly’s knowledge, denied admittance.</p>

<p>Her craft had a different effect from what she intended.</p>

<p>The report of Molly’s illness began to soften Cecil’s
obdurate heart.</p>

<p>His love, which had been smothered but not destroyed
by the discovery of her falsity, began to burn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
again with its pristine warmth and ardor, augmented
by sympathy with her illness, loneliness, and her delicate
condition of health.</p>

<p>He tried at first to beat down this reviving tenderness,
this exquisite pity, and to keep up the old feud;
but the memory of the past, when they had loved each
other so well, pleaded now for the lonely, humbled,
neglected wife.</p>

<p>“How happy we were, and how quickly the time
passed. I shall never be so happy again,” he said to
himself, sadly, and there came over him, in the words
of the poet, a yearning</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“To be friends; to be reconciled.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“I am foolish even to think of her,” he muttered,
impatiently. “But she looks so sad, so ill—what if she
should die?”</p>

<p>That thought frightened him, and showed him first
with what a passion he loved the frail creature who
had deceived him.</p>

<p>He went to his mother and asked her advice.</p>

<p>“Is it not time for me to forgive that poor girl?
What if she should die, mother?” he said.</p>

<p>“She will not die. There is no such good luck,” Mrs.
Laurens said, bitterly.</p>

<p>“For shame, mother! I did not know you could be
cruel enough to wish for any one’s death,” he exclaimed,
and flung out of the room hurt and indignant.</p>

<div class="chapter">

</div>


<p>He began to repent of that cruel letter he had written
to Molly, and to think that it would not be impossible
to forgive her for her treachery. He formed a
wistful habit of watching the door behind which she
had hidden herself from angry scrutiny, but it never
opened save for the egress or ingress of Florine who
regarded in such surprise the apparition of Monsieur
Cecil in the hall, that he would color up to his temples
and turn away.</p>

<p>Yet the longing to see his wife, to hear her voice,
grew upon Cecil daily, and much of his resentment
died. Once or twice he was tempted to knock boldly
at her door, to enter and take her in his arms, and tell
her he forgave everything, because he loved her so well
he could not live away from her presence. There was
but one thing that deterred him; it was the sight every
day in his room of the books Molly had sent back with
that maddening message.</p>

<p>The remembrance of that episode kept alive in his
breast a tiny spark of resentment.</p>

<p>“She should not have been so resentful, after all that
she had done. She should have accepted the first overture
I made toward peace,” he thought.</p>

<p>But Louise Barry was not idle. She foresaw all too
plainly that the time was not far distant when Cecil
Laurens’ love would break down his pride, and force
him to seek reconciliation with his lovely young wife.</p>

<p>“And when that hour comes I shall be lost, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
Molly will betray me as soon as she can find any one
to listen,” she said to herself.</p>

<p>The yellow eyes gleamed with fear and anger.</p>

<p>“It must not be!” she exclaimed, and a cruel purpose
entered her mind.</p>

<p>She sent for Florine Dabol that evening, and the
maid came to her in disguise, as she always did.</p>

<p>“Florine, you promised to rid me of that woman!”
she exclaimed, reproachfully.</p>

<p>The maid tossed her head.</p>

<p>“<i>Ma foi</i>, what can I do? I have tried to make her
desperate, so that she would run away or kill herself,
but she will do neither. Had any one told me the half
I have told her, I should have gone mad with jealousy.
But this girl—I never saw such sadness, such dumb
humility. She means to win him back by sheer humility
and patience.”</p>

<p>Louise shrugged her shoulders impatiently.</p>

<p>“I never should have believed it of Molly Trueheart,
she was always so fiery, yet she was good-natured, too,
at her best. I could wind her around my little finger
by cajolery.”</p>

<p>“And now, Mademoiselle?”</p>

<p>“I can not move her. She has grown stubborn
through her love for him,” Louise answered, frowning.</p>

<p>In a minute more she asked:</p>

<p>“And the husband, Florine? Has he made any more
overtures toward reconciliation?”</p>

<p>Florine answered with what seemed almost malicious
candor:</p>

<p>“It is only by constant strategy I keep them apart.
He is dying for her; one can see that plainly.”</p>

<p>“He is a fool. He does not seem to know that there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
is another woman in the world!” exclaimed the heiress,
whose clever plans for monopolizing Cecil had all
failed. Molly might be lost to him through her treachery,
but he never thought of Louise or any other.</p>

<p>Florine stayed an hour and they revolved many plans
before they decided on one. Then the maid hurried
home, always fearful that Cecil should catch her off
guard and make his way to Molly.</p>

<p>But she found her young mistress alone as usual, for
the other members of the family seldom entered the
sick-room.</p>

<p>Molly had fallen asleep on her sofa in her pretty
white <i>négligé</i>, and her maid, who had an eye for
beauty, gazed at her admiringly for some moments,
noticing that a tear had fallen and was only half dried
upon her cheek.</p>

<p>“How pretty she is! No wonder monsieur is so
ready to forgive her and love her again,” she thought.
“I wonder that Miss Barry can have the heart—I
shouldn’t, I know, but for the five hundred dollars.
But I need that so bad, or I wouldn’t, no, I wouldn’t
have been tempted to do such a deed. Whatever happens,
I’ll bet all my money he’ll never marry that
wicked Louise!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXIX">CHAPTER XXXIX.</h2>
</div>


<p>Florine Dabol had promised heartless Louise Barry
that she would poison the hapless creature before her;
but, as she gazed at the lovely sleeping face, so like
that of a grieved child that has sobbed itself to sleep,
a twinge of keen remorse tore her heart.</p>

<p>She was crafty and deceitful and fond of intrigues,
like all French maids; but she had never committed a
crime in her life, and she began to tremble now at the
enormity of what she had promised to do.</p>

<p>Vain and pretty, fond of finery, ease, and pleasure,
Florine’s god was money; and upon her avarice Louise
had cleverly worked, dazzling her with the promise of
five hundred dollars in gold when she should come and
tell her that deed of crime was accomplished and
Cecil Laurens’ young wife dead.</p>

<p>In Florine’s pocket was the tiny powder that, placed
in Molly’s glass, was to accomplish the deed; and
Louise, with the powder, had given the maid a note
that was such a perfect copy of Molly’s writing that,
when found in her room next morning, it would be
enough to convince every one that Molly had committed
suicide.</p>

<p>It was a clever plan, and there was nothing to prevent
its being carried out successfully. Molly lay there,
weak and helpless, in her enemy’s power.</p>

<p>Yet in that very helplessness lay her defense against
the powers of evil.</p>

<p>For Florine Dabol, as she stood there fingering the
poison in her pocket and gazing at the lovely, sorrowful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
face, felt moved and troubled, and her feeling of
her mistress’ helplessness found expression in an exclamation
of profound remorse and pity:</p>

<p>“Poor baby!”</p>

<p>For Molly, in her youth, innocence, and grief,
seemed like an infant, in the eyes of the maturer maid,
and an intense repugnance to her contemplated horrible
deed rushed over her soul.</p>

<p>She turned away and went into the dressing-room,
dropping softly into a chair, that she might not awake
the sleeper.</p>

<p>“I can’t—I can’t do it! I must find some other way
to earn the money. I can’t have that poor thing’s blood
on my soul! She would haunt me, and I should get no
rest from those hollow black eyes!” she muttered, fearfully.</p>

<p>Evidently Florine’s good angel was pleading with
her, for she sat there wrapped in thought while in the
next room Molly slept sweetly, unconscious of the
danger hovering near her in such deadly form.</p>

<p>An hour passed and Florine still sat in her chair,
and now and then muttered words escaped her lips.</p>

<p>“She is so good and sweet and patient. She has
never given me a cross word for all the dreadful lies
I’ve told her about her splendid husband. How can I
kill the gentle creature?”</p>

<p>She thought, suddenly:</p>

<p>“If I could only tell her something very dreadful,
that would make her go away from The Acacias forever,
it would be the same as killing her.”</p>

<p>Poor Molly! Yes, it would be the same, for to that
devoted heart life without her husband would be death
far worse than death.</p>

<p>Florine rose up and went noisily into the next room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span></p>

<p>Molly started, broad awake, and sat up looking in
alarm at the maid.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, Mrs. Laurens. I’m afraid I
disturbed you talking to myself in such a loud voice.
I was so angry I couldn’t help it, madame,” said
Florine.</p>

<p>“What has made you angry, Florine?” asked the
sad, gentle voice.</p>

<p>“Oh, madame, I oughtn’t to tell you on no account;
but it’s a shame their goings-on, and you sick and not
able to help yourself.”</p>

<p>“Florine, I don’t understand you,” wistfully.</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s best you don’t, madame, for if you did
you wouldn’t stay with such a shameless man, planning
a second marriage while you’re alive, and likely to be
for many years, not but that <i>her</i> will’s good to poison
you if she had a fair chance.”</p>

<p>Molly sat upright with frightened eyes.</p>

<p>“Yes, Florine, I know Miss Barry hates me,” she
shuddered. “But—but—you <i>are</i> my friend, aren’t you?
Don’t, oh, don’t let her kill me, please!”</p>

<p>“Not if I can help it, madame, never!” cried the
maid. “But what can I do? When she bribes me to
poison you and I refuse she’s going to manage it some
other way, certainly. You’re in <i>her</i> way and <i>his</i>—don’t
you know that, my poor young lady?—and,”
dropping her voice to a warning whisper, “your life
is more and more in danger every hour you stay in
this house.”</p>

<p>She watched the beautiful face closely. It could
scarcely grow more pale, but it was wild and startled.</p>

<p>“Florine, don’t let her kill me. I—I—will win my
husband’s love back some day,” she moaned, holding
out her trembling little hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span></p>

<p>Florine tossed her head.</p>

<p>“Never, never!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Hush, Florine!” sternly.</p>

<p>“Very well, madame,” resignedly.</p>

<p>She sat quiet a few moments until Molly’s jealous
love conquered her pride.</p>

<p>“Florine Dabol, why do you say such things to me?
Do you believe that Louise has won my husband’s love
from me?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“It is plain to be seen, madame. Such goings-on!”
Florine tossed her head and shrugged her shoulders in
a way that expressed volumes.</p>

<p>Molly gazed at her with eyes full of pain, and Florine
said to herself that she was making good progress
indeed.</p>

<p>“Madame, you are too good, you are indeed. I would
not live with a man that hated me openly, and spent
all his time with another woman. It is cruel, it is
shameful!” warmly.</p>

<p>Not a word came from Molly’s blanched, writhing
lips, but she watched Florine’s face with burning eyes.</p>

<p>The maid continued:</p>

<p>“Madame, where are all your friends and relations?
Why do you not write to them to come to your aid,
and make your husband treat you with common respect.
If he will not do that let them take you away
from him, for this life of loneliness and neglect is killing
you by inches.”</p>

<p>“That is true,” Molly gasped with white lips.</p>

<p>“I would bear it no longer, madame. I would go
away out of his life forever since they both wish for
it and pray for it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Florine, you are mistaken. He is angry with
me, but if I am only patient he will pity and forgive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
me soon, I hope. And—and—he is going to take me
home next week that—our child may be born at his old
ancestral home,” Molly cried, piteously.</p>

<p>Florine gazed at her in expressive silence a moment.</p>

<p>“You see he does not hate me as bad as you think,”
Molly cried eagerly, and Florine sighed aloud.</p>

<p>Then she asked gravely:</p>

<p>“My poor young lady, who told you he was going to
take you home?”</p>

<p>Molly answered: “Mrs. Laurens, his mother.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how cruel!” the maid cried warmly. “They
have deceived you, madame. I have taken pains to find
out their plans and now I will give them to you. It is
not Mr. Cecil who will take you home. You are to go
with the old folks and the daughters. He—your husband—remains
behind with the Barrys, and they all
three go immediately to Paris. Ah, madame, Paris is
so wicked! And the aunt, the chaperone, she is so old,
blind, deaf, she will see but little of the goings-on!”</p>

<p>Florine’s shrugs and glances conveyed even more
evil than her words.</p>

<p>“Florine, are you sure, quite sure, of all you have
told me?” Molly asked in a dejected voice.</p>

<p>“Madame, I am willing to take an oath,” Florine replied
glibly, and for a moment there was a deep silence.
The maid was afraid that her mistress was going to
faint, but Molly sat upright as a statue. Presently
she spoke.</p>

<p>“No one could blame me if I went away to my own
friends and left him forever, could they, Florine?”</p>

<p>“No one, madame, for you have had provocation
enough to drive you desperate; but your friends, where
are they?” curiously.</p>

<p>“No matter. I am not utterly friendless, Florine,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
and since they are trying to drive me desperate, why
should I go back to America to please them?” angrily.
“Why not stay here with my kindred and spare myself
the torture of trying to win back a heart that has
passed from my keeping forever?”</p>

<p>She spoke rather to herself than to the maid, but
Florine said eagerly:</p>

<p>“Ah, madame, you begin to talk sensibly now, for I
tell you plainly that if you stay here much longer, Miss
Barry will find means to remove you from her path.
Oh, I am so sorry for you, my sweet young mistress,
or I would not tell you this. But I am frightened for
you, madame, and I know when you go back to
America, where I can not go with you, you will have
no one to watch over you like your poor Florine!”</p>

<p>It was all very genuine, all very eloquent, as Florine
poured it out, and Molly’s heart warmed to the maid
whom she had once distrusted.</p>

<p>“Florine, you are very good to me,” she exclaimed,
gratefully. She pulled a pretty ruby ring from her
finger, and holding it out to her, said, in a voice choked
with misery: “Take this to remember me when I am
gone.”</p>

<p>The treacherous woman took the gift with profuse
thanks and inward joy, for Molly’s last words had assured
her that her scheme had succeeded.</p>

<p>She would go away—poor, desolate Molly—and she,
Florine would be spared the taking of human life.</p>

<p>“Madame, let me go with you and care for you,” she
said, curious to know where she would go.</p>

<p>But Molly shook her head.</p>

<p>“No, no, Florine; I shall go alone,” she said, hopelessly;
but the maid said to herself:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span></p>

<p>“I shall be sure to find you out, any way, for I want
to keep track of you.”</p>

<p>She saw Molly looking at the pretty clock on the
mantel, and thought, exultantly:</p>

<p>“She will go tonight, and tomorrow Miss Barry shall
pay me the money, for this is just as good as if I had
killed her,” she decided.</p>

<p>“You may go now, Florine; it is past my usual bed-time,
but I shall sit up awhile,” said Molly.</p>

<p>The maid withdrew with a respectful good-night.
She knew well that she had been dismissed because
her young mistress desired to make secret preparations
for flight.</p>

<p>She was right in her conjecture, for in less than half
an hour the despairing wife stole away from The Acacias
and took her solitary way through the London
streets in the moonless darkness of the summer night.</p>

<p>Molly had determined to go to the Truehearts, tell
them her whole sad history, and ask them to love her
for her father’s sake.</p>

<p>“They can not turn me away, they are too fond of
me already,” she said, hopefully to herself. “If they
will only hide me from my enemies I shall love them
and be grateful to them forever.”</p>

<p>She had begun to look on Cecil as her enemy now,
as one who wished for her death that he might marry
his new love.</p>

<p>“But they shall not kill me. I shall die soon enough
of my broken heart anyhow,” she said sadly.</p>

<p>She would not take a cab, weak as she was, for she
wanted to make it impossible for any one to trace her,
so she walked wearily and slowly along over the full
mile that intervened between The Acacias and the
elegant mansion of the Truehearts.</p>

<p>For a wonder no rough or rowdy molested the small,
veiled female figure as it plodded along. Perhaps it
was because every one but Molly herself saw that she
was guarded by another woman who kept just a little
behind the other and always in the shadow.</p>

<p>It was Florine Dabol, bent on finding out all about
the mysterious friends at whom Molly had vaguely
hinted.</p>

<p>“It may be worth my while to know where she is all
the time when they are hunting her high and low!” she
cleverly thought.</p>

<p>She was amazed and confounded when she saw her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
mistress ascend the stone steps of a splendid mansion,
more and more amazed when she saw her after ringing
the bell and waiting but a few moments, disappear
within the stately door.</p>

<p>“Well, she’s got fine friends anyhow,” said Florine.
She ascended the steps and read the name upon the
door-plate.</p>

<p>“Sir Edward Trueheart, upon my word,” she ejaculated.</p>

<p>She waited a while in the shadow of the steps to see
if her mistress would come forth again, but seeing
that she did not, took her way hastily back to The Acacias
and went in by the servants’ entrance, the key of
which she had carried when she went out. As she did
so the clock in the hall chimed the midnight hour.</p>

<p>“I will run up to her room and see if she has left
him a note,” she said.</p>

<p>To her amazement, as she entered the dimly lighted
upper hall, she encountered Cecil Laurens, who had
just let himself in with his latch-key. He looked haggard
and wretched in the dim light.</p>

<p>“Florine!” he exclaimed, in surprise, at sight of the
cloaked and bonneted figure.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I have been to the theater. My mistress
gave me this evening out,” answered the artful maid,
thinking that she could turn this seemingly awkward
<i>contretemps</i> to good account.</p>

<p>He hesitated a moment, then asked, eagerly:</p>

<p>“Do you think that Mrs. Laurens is awake yet, Florine?”</p>

<p>“I expect so, sir. She does not sleep well at night
for fretting and crying.”</p>

<p>The words struck his heart with pain and reproach.</p>

<p>“‘Fretting and crying,’ and no one to comfort her,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
poor child!” he thought, and held up his hand. “Wait,”
he said.</p>

<p>He drew pencil and paper from his pocket, and
wrote rapidly some words that had been burning his
heart all day:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“My darling wife, forgive me for that cruel letter.
My love has conquered pride, anger and resentment.
Let us throw the past behind us, and begin life anew.
May I come to you and hear the story I once refused
to listen to from you?</p>

<p class="right right-indent">
<span class="smcap">Your Own Cecil.</span>”<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>He folded the note hurriedly across and put it into
Florine’s hand with a gold piece.</p>

<p>“That’s for your kindness to my wife, my good
girl,” he said. “Now, if she is awake, give her the
note at once. If she is asleep, let her have it as soon
as she awakens. I shall wait here a few minutes to
hear from you.”</p>

<p>Florine courtesied low, took the note and disappeared
in a moment inside that door on which Cecil’s
wistful eyes were eagerly fastened. Then she thrust
the note into her pocket and looked eagerly around
the room.</p>

<p>“Ah!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>There was a note, as she had expected—a note not
even sealed.</p>

<p>It lay upon a little table at the head of the bed where
Florine usually placed the glass of water Molly drank
at night.</p>

<p>Florine read the brief note hastily and without compunction.</p>

<p>Then she put it back upon the table and opened the
door, beckoning excitedly to Cecil, who was waiting at
the stair-way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span></p>

<p>He came hurriedly, believing that Molly had summoned
him, eager, like himself, for a reconciliation.</p>

<p>He stepped quickly across the threshold, and Florine
panted, wildly:</p>

<p>“Ah, monsieur! what does it mean? She—my mistress—is
not here!”</p>

<p>She ran into the dressing-room and bath-room and
back again, followed by Cecil, startled and anxious.</p>

<p>“<i>Ma foi</i>, I have feared this—that she would run
away!” Florine muttered, just loud enough for him to
overhear.</p>

<p>He turned on her fiercely.</p>

<p>“Woman, you must be mad! She can not have left
the house. Go and seek her at once.”</p>

<p>But at that moment his eyes fell on the note.</p>

<p>He snatched it up hurriedly and read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Mr. Laurens</span>,—You have said that you would read
nothing from me, but doubtless you will make an exception
of this welcome note that tells you that I have
gone away out of your path forever.</p>

<p>“I have learned that I am to be sent to your home in
America next week, while you remain behind to enjoy
the companionship of the wicked woman you love. The
ostensible reason is that my child may be born at
Maple Shade. I prefer to go to my own friends, where
the blessing that is coming into my blighted life may
come into the world under the same English skies
where my forefathers first saw the light. If I stayed
with you, you would hate both me and the little one,
so we will go where we shall be sure of a little love
and kindness.</p>

<p>“Farewell—a long farewell.</p>

<p>Cecil Laurens turned sternly upon the deceitful
maid.</p>

<p>“You say that you expected, feared this. Why did
you not warn me?” He exclaimed in a voice whose
stern impatience did not hide its key-note of agony.</p>

<p>“<i>Ma foi</i>, monsieur, I thought you did not care,”
Florine replied insolently.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” he stormed; and she answered
with pretending humility:</p>

<p>“Monsieur neglected his wife and she was wretched.
She cried out often that there was one in her own land
who loved her, and that she repented now that she
had left him for Monsieur Laurens! If only she could
find him again—”</p>

<p>“Stop!” Cecil thundered angrily.</p>

<p>She paused obediently.</p>

<p>“Who has tutored you to this falsehood?” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Florine muttered cringingly:</p>

<p>“I am sorry monsieur is angry, but it is the truth I
speak. Madame was lonely and dissatisfied. What
more natural than that she should fly from a cold husband
to a devoted lover in her own land?”</p>

<p>An impulse came over him to strike down the impudent
woman at his feet for those maddening words.
He restrained himself with difficulty.</p>

<p>“She is foolish and ignorant,” he said to himself,
and flung the letter toward her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span></p>

<p>“Read that and see how you have misjudged your
mistress!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>He watched her closely, and he saw the plainest incredulity
upon her face.</p>

<p>“What do you think now?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Monsieur does not wish my real opinion?” reluctantly.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Very well. I should believe this letter only that
Madame Laurens made me bring her the daily paper
today and read aloud the shipping news. There was
one steamer that sailed tonight just before midnight.”</p>

<p>“That proves nothing,” he said curtly.</p>

<p>“No, nothing,” agreed Florine. Then with a deep-drawn
sigh: “Only madame wept so bitterly, and
exclaimed, ‘No one could blame me if I left my unloving
husband and went back to my friend!’”</p>

<p>He looked at her sternly, as if trying to pierce the
secrets of her false breast, but she continued unfalteringly:</p>

<p>“Ah, I have lived with so many fine ladies, I know
their ways. It might be only a coincidence, but why
did she send me away tonight? Why was she so anxious
I should go to the theater?”</p>

<p>“Hush! No more!” he said, hoarsely, and Florine
bowed mockingly.</p>

<p>“You believe, then, Florine, that her note was a
blind, and that she sailed tonight for America?”</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly, monsieur.”</p>

<p>“Great heavens! I wish you had warned me!” he
exclaimed.</p>

<p>“I thought you would be glad to be rid of an unloved
wife,” low and tauntingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span></p>

<p>“Go!” he said, threateningly; then as suddenly recalled
her. “This scandal must be kept a secret,” he
said. “The servants even must not know. The price
of your silence?” sternly.</p>

<p>“I am incapable of telling; but if fifty pounds—”
she began.</p>

<p>“My check shall be yours tomorrow, so that you
may be sure to hold your tongue,” he said, taking
Molly’s note, and turning away to seek counsel with
his parents.</p>

<p>They had just come in from some fashionable revel,
and recoiled in alarm at his haggard, agitated looks.</p>

<p>When he had told them all, they declared that Florine
was doubtless in the right. The letter had been a
blind to keep him in London while Molly fled to
America to join John Keith.</p>

<p>“She has loved him all the time, and she has found
out that your wealth will not console her for his loss,”
Mrs. Laurens said, bitterly.</p>

<p>“As to her having English relations, that is all bosh,
of course,” said Cecil’s father. “If she had had them,
we should have heard of them before.”</p>

<p>No one had ever thought of Sir Edward Trueheart
in connection with poor Molly. No one had ever credited
her with having respectable relations.</p>

<p>“I shall follow her by the next steamer, and let John
Keith beware if I find him in company with my faithless
wife!” Cecil Laurens exclaimed, furiously.</p>

<p>He kept his word; but, as no steamer sailed for a
week, he was detained in London six days longer. So
that, when he went, at last, his parents and sisters went
with him, as had already been arranged. Doctor Laurens
alone of the family remained behind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span></p>

<p>A bitter note from Cecil and a letter from his
mother had duly informed him of Molly’s flight.</p>

<p>The noble, honest young physician was amazed,
dumfounded.</p>

<p>“How could she do it? I thought she loved him,”
he said, but then remembering all Molly’s treachery
in the past he was fain to believe what they said of
her now.</p>

<p>“I was deceived in her. Her beauty and her apparent
guilelessness led my judgment astray,” he decided,
and a great indignation took possession of his mind
against the girl whose part he had taken so nobly.</p>

<p>He wrote to his brother that she had not been
worthy of his love, and that the only thing he could
do now was to cast her from his heart.</p>

<p>Louise Barry said the same thing when they confided
to her the secret of Molly’s flight.</p>

<p>“It is what I have expected all the time,” she said.
“Molly never cared for Mr. Laurens. It was his money
that tempted her, and she has found out now that John
Keith’s love was more to her than gold. Mr. Laurens
ought to cast her from his heart forever.”</p>

<p>“I have told him I should be glad if he would divorce
her, but he will not agree to do so,” said Cecil’s
mother.</p>

<p>“I wish he would,” said Louise, and the aspiration
came from her heart.</p>

<p>She was secretly enraged and frightened at the failure
of the scheme she had intrusted to Florine Dabol.</p>

<p>“As long as Molly Trueheart lives the sword of
Damocles will be suspended by a single hair over my
head,” she thought, angrily, and in her disappointment
she had at first refused to pay the promised bribe to
the Frenchwoman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span></p>

<p>But Florine was insolent.</p>

<p>“Very well,” she said, “break your promise if you
will, and I know where to find Madame Laurens at any
moment. And upon my soul I believe I should feel
happier in reconciling that deceived husband and wife
than in taking the gold you promised me for keeping
them apart.”</p>

<p>That threat frightened Louise and she paid Florine,
after binding her solemnly to keep Molly still apart
from her husband.</p>

<p>“That will be easy to do if you will only make your
arrangements to return to America with the Laurens
family. It will lend color to the stories I have told her
of her husband’s love for you,” said the maid.</p>

<p>“But if she should follow us, if she should relent
and come back to her husband?”</p>

<p>“She will not do it. She is too proud. But even if
she should attempt such a thing I will prevent it,” declared
Florine.</p>

<p>So Louise and her Aunt Thalia returned to America
on the same steamer with the Laurens family. Mrs.
Barry had been longing for Ferndale for weeks, and so
Louise found it easy to throw the blame of her return
upon the old lady.</p>

<p>“I have not the heart to keep her away from home
any longer, however reluctant I may be to leave London
before the gay season is over,” she said, with an
affectation of dutifulness that did not deceive the
keen-sighted old lady, who knew already that her niece
was selfish and cold-hearted, and cared for nothing but
money.</p>

<p>But she was glad to go home again on any terms, so
she did not even suffer herself to look sarcastic at
Louise’s hypocrisy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span></p>

<p>She knew she had to make the best of the heiress for
whom poor Molly had been discarded.</p>

<p>They went home, and Cecil set out to trace Molly
and her lover, vowing to himself a dark revenge upon
the man for whom his wife had deserted and disgraced
him.</p>

<p>The Barry and Laurens families became more intimate
than ever. There was an unspoken desire on each
side that Cecil would procure a divorce from his faithless
wife and marry the real Louise Barry.</p>

<p>There seemed small prospect of their hopes being
gratified, for the angry husband did not give up the
quest for John Keith for two years, and during those
two years he never once came home.</p>

<p>Letters came from him but seldom. He was always
on the wing—always following some new clue, spending
money like water in the effort to trace the fugitives.
Mrs. Laurens complained that he was spending all his
income in that wild and foolish pursuit, but to her entreaties
that he would come home he paid not the
slightest heed. She had not given him much sympathy
in his sorrow and his heart had grown cold to her. He
felt vaguely that her <i>hauteur</i> had helped to drive his
wife to despair and flight.</p>

<p>“If we had not neglected her so much, if we had
pitied and forgiven her a little sooner, her heart would
not have turned against me,” he thought often; and
remembering how his mother had tried to keep up the
feud, he found it hard to forgive her interference.</p>

<p>But the sudden death of his father nearly three years
after his wife’s flight brought the wanderer home
again.</p>

<p>Nina had married a year ago, and gone to a home
in Richmond, of which she was the light and life. Only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
the mother and Dot remained at Maple Shade, where
the family of six had once made everything bright and
cheerful.</p>

<p>“You must never leave us again, Cecil,” they said,
piteously, and he stayed with them in their loneliness
and sorrow until another year had rolled by.</p>

<p>Then Doctor Charley Laurens came home, and
brought a lovely English bride, for whom the family
threw off its somber mourning and made merry.</p>

<p>Nina and her husband came from Richmond, Louise
Barry from Ferndale, other guests from Lewisburg,
until the large house was full of friends who came to
join in the festivities over the marriage and return of
the favorite son.</p>

<p>Then the bride was lovely, rich, and of gentle birth.
She was a cousin of Lord Westerley.</p>

<p>“He knows you all, both he and his wife,” she said.</p>

<p>“We knew Lord Westerley, but he was not married,”
Mrs. Laurens answered.</p>

<p>“He must have married soon after you left, for
Madelon Trueheart has been his wife four years,” answered
the vivacious bride.</p>

<p>“Then he married Madelon Trueheart?” Cecil exclaimed,
rousing from his usual apathetic manner. He
remembered that beautiful Madelon Trueheart had
been his wife’s friend. Molly had told him that Madelon
would not leave her parents to marry her lover.</p>

<p>He said carelessly that he had heard this, without
adding that his lost wife told him.</p>

<p>Pretty, young Mrs. Laurens answered, eagerly:</p>

<p>“How noble that was in beautiful Madelon, or Lady
Westerley as she is now. Happily a missing relative
turned up and took her place in the heart of Sir Edward
and his wife, and left Madelon free to marry.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span></p>

<p>“A missing relative?” Cecil repeated, with a start;
then, eagerly: “But I thought she was the last of the
race.”</p>

<p>“Then you have never heard of Sir Edward’s disinherited
son? He made a low marriage, and his people
would not forgive him. But he died soon after, and
they repented and sent for his wife and child, who
came and stayed with them, and made happiness possible
for Madelon and Lord Westerley.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Cecil, his momentary flash of interest
dying out.</p>

<p>A moment’s eager suspicion had awakened in him,
then died out again. He had no interest in the widow
and child of Sir Edward’s son, as the bride, who was a
little awry in her facts, called them.</p>

<p>“Poor Sir Edward! They say he tried to make up
in kindness to them for his cruelty to his son,” continued
the pretty English girl. “He died last year; and
after what came by law of entail to his wife and
grandson, he gave all the rest of his money to the beautiful
Mrs. Trueheart.”</p>

<p>“Was she beautiful?” asked Dot, who adored
beauty.</p>

<p>“As a dream!” replied her sister-in-law, enthusiastically.
“I have heard her called the most beautiful
lady in England, and no one speaks of her low
birth now, since Sir Edward took her up and left her
so much money. Lord and Lady Westerley adore her
and her child.”</p>

<p>“They ought to do so, since she brought them their
happiness,” said some one; and then the conversation
languished, as no one took any interest in Sir Edward
Trueheart’s relative except Mrs. Doctor Charley.</p>

<p>Charley himself, who had never met any of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
Truehearts for years, had no suspicion of the truth
that the Mrs. Trueheart of his wife’s story was his
brother’s missing wife and Sir Edward Trueheart’s
granddaughter—not his daughter-in-law, as the bungling
story ran. He did not even connect the name
with Molly Trueheart, whose mother had been an actress
and her father, no doubt, an actor.</p>

<p>“Cecil,” his mother said one week later, “do you
never intend to marry again?”</p>

<p>“You forget that I have a wife already,” with a
frown.</p>

<p>“Do not speak of her!” impatiently. “No doubt she
is dead, but you ought to have got a divorce from her
long ago. Do you not see that Louise Barry is dying
for you?”</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” he replied curtly. “I see nothing of the
kind.”</p>

<p>“You must certainly have observed a change in her,”
persisted Mrs. Laurens.</p>

<p>“Yes, her beauty is fading as might be expected.
She must be almost thirty,” he replied cynically.</p>

<p>“She is five years younger than you, at least,” reprovingly.
“And she might have been married long
ago. She has had suitors enough. But I believe she
has loved you all the time.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” he said again.</p>

<p>“But, Cecil, you would be so much happier if you
married again, and you would please us all if you
took Louise.”</p>

<p>“I would do much to please you, mother, but not
this. I shall never love again. My heart’s wealth was
poured out on my false young wife, and all its powers
were wasted. If you wish me to stay with you, leave
me at peace on this subject. I never expect to marry
again,” he answered, sadly but decisively.</p>

<p>Mrs. Laurens sighed deeply, and looked out of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
window of the library where they were sitting together.</p>

<p>To change the conversation she said carelessly:</p>

<p>“There is a strange man and a pretty little girl coming
up the maple avenue.”</p>

<p>Cecil made no answer. He was pretending to be absorbed
in a book. His mother relapsed into silence,
watching curiously the man and child coming up the
maple avenue, over the drifts of autumn leaves that
strewed the ground with a gold and crimson carpet.</p>

<p>He was a good-looking man well dressed in a black
suit, with the air and manner of a gentleman. The
child he led by the hand was about five years old,
daintily dressed in crimson cashmere and a broad
white Leghorn hat, beneath which fell soft golden
curls, framing a pretty, tear-stained little face.</p>

<p>Mrs. Laurens saw the man and child going up the
steps, and a sudden vague suspicion darted into her
mind.</p>

<p>“That strange child, good Heaven, what if Molly
Trueheart has sent Cecil’s child home at last!” she
muttered.</p>

<p>The door-bell clanged loudly, making her start with
excitement. The next moment the library door opened
and a servant handed in a card.</p>

<p>Mrs. Laurens glanced at Cecil. He was paying no
attention to the little by-play. She glanced down again
at the card, and read:</p>

<p class="center">
“<i>John Keith to see Mrs. Laurens.</i>”<br>
</p>

<p>“Gemmon in de parlor, mistis,” said the old colored
man, and Mrs. Laurens followed him without a word.</p>

<p>She went along the wide hall, shaking with emotion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, heavenly powers, the man must be mad to
come here. Cecil will murder him,” she muttered, in
terror. “But I was right. It is the child, as my
heart foreboded. That woman must be dead, or she
would not have been brought here.”</p>

<p>She opened the door and went in, a pale, handsome,
haughty old lady in black silk, before whose severe
aspect John Keith, sensitive as ever, recoiled in dismay.</p>

<p>“You wished to see me, sir?” frigidly.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon. There is some mistake,” he
faltered.</p>

<p>“There is no mistake, I am Mrs. Laurens,” impatiently.</p>

<p>“Then you are Cecil Laurens’ mother?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I wished to see Mrs. Cecil Laurens!”</p>

<p>She recoiled from him in anger and reproach.</p>

<p>“How can you speak that name here?” she exclaimed.
“You of all men ought to know that there
is no longer a Mrs. Cecil Laurens! Or, perhaps, you
think my son has married again?”</p>

<p>The handsome man before her sank back into his
seat like one stunned. His face paled, his voice trembled
as he said:</p>

<p>“Madame, I do not understand. Do you mean to
tell me that your son’s wife is dead! poor, pretty
Molly—dead?” mournfully.</p>

<p>“I thought you came here to tell us <i>that</i>?” pointedly.
“Whose child is that?” with a loathing gesture.</p>

<p>“Mine, madame,” proudly.</p>

<p>“And hers, Molly Trueheart’s!” exclaimed Mrs.
Laurens scornfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span></p>

<p>He looked at her, wondering if she could be mad.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Laurens, answer me one question if you can,”
he said impatiently. “Where is Mrs. Cecil Laurens if
she is not dead?”</p>

<p>“I do not know. Cecil—we all thought she was with
you,” hopelessly.</p>

<p>“My God, Mrs. Laurens, I have never seen sweet
little Molly since her wedding night! Why should she
come to me?”</p>

<p>“She ran away from Cecil four years ago. Every
one thought she went to you,” Mrs. Laurens faltered,
her heart beating fast with excitement.</p>

<p>He sprang up again, startled, incredulous. “Why
should she leave her husband; why should she come
to me, madame?” he demanded.</p>

<p>Mrs. Laurens looked at him in a dazed way and muttered,
“Was she not your divorced wife?”</p>

<p>“No, a thousand times, no! She was my sweet little
friend—no more. My God, what subtle treachery am
I about to unearth?” exclaimed John Keith wildly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Laurens sat down and put her hand to her
head. “You are deceiving me,” she muttered.</p>

<p>“Madame, I am not,” he answered coldly. “But I
begin to scent treachery. Look at this child. She is
mine by a heartless wife who divorced herself from
me that she might inherit an old woman’s money.
The child, deserted by her heartless mother, was left
with an aunt, who, in dying, left the child to me. I
came here to ask my kind friend, Molly, to keep the
child for me until I could make some arrangements.
Go, madame, bring Cecil Laurens here! Let me hear
his story!”</p>

<p>She rose up from her chair, white and trembling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span></p>

<p>“Wait then,” she said in broken tones. “I must
tell him first all that you have told me, or else he would
murder you at sight!”</p>

</div>


<p>She went with uncertain footsteps along the hall to
the library, and left him alone. The little child, seeing
him fall into a dejected attitude, slipped away and
entered the back parlor, which was curtained from the
front one by falling velvet curtains.</p>

<p>She found a picture-book and sat down upon the
floor to turn the leaves, without noting the presence
of an old lady in gray silk, sitting quietly with folded
hands in a large arm-chair.</p>

<p>The old lady was Mrs. Barry, who was spending the
day at Maple Shade. She had been sitting in the front
parlor with Mrs. Laurens, and they had been talking
of the subject that was nearest to both their hearts,
the desired union between Cecil and Louise.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Laurens left her to go and sound Cecil
on that important theme she slipped into the back parlor,
and sat down to doze a little in the large arm-chair.
The sound of voices in the next room roused
her, and sitting there quietly, she heard every word
that passed.</p>

<p>When the pretty child came in, Mrs. Barry stared at
her in angry amaze. The little beauty, with her yellowish
hazel eyes and falling yellow curls, was a miniature
edition of Louise Barry.</p>

<p>“What does it mean?” the old lady asked herself,
nervously.</p>

<p>She sat still, watching the little one with fascinated
eyes, unheeding the lapse of time, until she was
roused again by voices in the next room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Laurens had brought Cecil in, after first telling
him all that John Keith had explained to her; and
after the lapse of five years, the two men were face to
face again.</p>

<p>Mutual explanations ensued, and the treachery of
Louise Barry was fully unveiled at last.</p>

<p>“She and I were lovers before she had any expectations
of a fortune from her aunt,” he said. “Mrs. Everett
objected to me because I was a traveling salesman,
and Louise and I were married secretly, taking no one
but Molly into our confidence. Very soon afterward I
lost my situation, and was away for months seeking
work in vain. My wife found herself in a delicate situation,
and became enraged because I was not in a
position to declare our marriage and support her properly.
Then came that fatal letter from Mrs. Barry that
ruined all my life.”</p>

<p>Sighing heavily, he continued:</p>

<p>“That rich, heartless old woman wrote to Louise
that she should be her heiress in case she were unmarried
and would accept the man she had in view for
her; but if she were a married woman, the matter
ended there, and she should leave her property to
build an orphan asylum.”</p>

<p>No one saw the heavy velvet curtains part and an
old woman’s face peer cautiously through the aperture.
All were too much absorbed in that story of duplicity
and deceit on the part of a beautiful, ambitious woman.</p>

<p>John Keith went on, bitterly:</p>

<p>“That letter transformed Louise into a demon, it
seemed. She was determined to secure the fortune she
had forfeited by her secret marriage. She took her
aunt into her confidence, and they formed a clever,
dastardly scheme.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span></p>

<p>“Ah!” exclaimed Cecil Laurens, with a start.</p>

<p>“You may well start in horror, since you, as well as
myself, were a victim of that plot,” said John Keith.
“But to return to my story: Louise was not in a condition
to make the visit that Mrs. Barry demanded
rather than requested. The pretty little madcap, Molly
Trueheart, Louise’s step-sister, was tutored to act a
part and sent to Ferndale as a substitute.”</p>

<p>“Poor child!” exclaimed Cecil Laurens, beginning to
understand it all.</p>

<p>“It was a bold game, for Molly was expected to
keep it up as long as the old lady lived; but there
seemed no other way possible. Louise was determined
that the will should be made in her favor, and sweet
little Molly, who had something of the actress in her
veins by inheritance, declared that it would be jolly
fun to play the heiress,” John Keith said, sadly, adding,
soberly: “There was no fault in Molly Trueheart,
except that in one thing she disobeyed her instructions.”</p>

<p>“And that?” Cecil Laurens asked, breathlessly.</p>

<p>“Was in her marriage to you,” replied the other.
“In the fact that Mrs. Barry had in view a possible
husband for Louise lay the greatest danger of the
whole scheme. Louise bade Molly repel the chosen
man by every scheme in her power, so that he should
of his own choice reject an alliance with her, thereby
breaking off the match without offending Mrs. Barry.”</p>

<p>Cecil Laurens cried out, remorsefully:</p>

<p>“She did, poor girl, she did use every means to disenchant
me. I remember it all now, her frowns, her
pretty petulance, her terror at the thought of becoming
my wife. But when I found she loved me, I would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
brook no refusals. Between Mrs. Barry and myself
she was almost forced into that marriage.”</p>

<p>“She was a pitiable victim of circumstances,” said
John Keith. “She had promised Louise to act a part,
and could not get released from her promise. If she
had refused the marriage, Mrs. Barry would have disinherited
her niece.”</p>

<p>“But she loved me,” Cecil Laurens said, quickly.</p>

<p>“She adored you,” answered John Keith; “she told
me so. She revealed to me the whole plot, and begged
me to keep the secret. I must beg your pardon for
this, Mr. Laurens, but how could I betray my noble
friend Molly, and my heartless but idolized wife?”</p>

<p>“She, your wife, deserved no kindness at your
hands,” said Cecil, angrily.</p>

<p>“She did not, that is true; but I was weak enough
to love her still, and I went from your marriage to
Staunton to see her. I found only her aunt, who told
me that Louise’s child had died, and that she had gone
away as a traveling governess with a rich lady. You
know all the rest, Mr. Laurens—how she divorced
herself from me so heartlessly and broke my heart.
I went South and engaged in the business of orange
growing several years, until a restless yearning drove
me back here, or rather to Staunton, where I found
Mrs. Everett on her death-bed.”</p>

<p>“She confessed all, then?” said Cecil.</p>

<p>“Yes, and produced my little daughter whom she
had falsely said was dead. She told me that everything
was right between my former wife and Mrs.
Barry, that she had found out and forgiven the deception
about Molly, but that Louise dared not confess
to her marriage and the child.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span></p>

<p>“The wicked woman!” Mrs. Laurens exclaimed,
finding voice at last.</p>

<p>Apparently John Keith’s heart still held some lingering
tenderness for the woman who had deceived him,
for his brow clouded, and he said quickly:</p>

<p>“I do not think she was altogether wicked, Mrs.
Laurens. Her Aunt Lucy told me that she had a passionate
love for our child, which she visited secretly
several times every year, and that much of the income
Mrs. Barry allowed her for pin-money was expended
for the child, that it might be reared in luxury.”</p>

<p>They told him of all her falsehood and treachery by
which poor Molly’s life had been wrecked and ruined,
and the strong man shed tears of bitter sorrow and
regret.</p>

<p>“I will search the world over that I may find your
wife and bring her back to you, if you will say that
you forgive her the one deceitful act of wedding you
under a false identity!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“I would have forgiven her that at first. It was the
thought of what she had been to you, and of her
treachery to all that rankled most bitterly in my heart,”
answered Cecil, agitatedly.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Barry is here. Shall we not tell her of her
niece’s treachery?” exclaimed Mrs. Laurens, indignant
at the fraud that had been practiced on them all, and
remorseful and ashamed at the part she had taken in
persecuting Cecil’s wife.</p>

<p>“Can we not spare poor, ambitious Louise?” exclaimed
John Keith, almost pleadingly.</p>

<p>The velvet curtains parted, and Mrs. Barry, sterner
and grimmer and uglier than ever, stepped inside the
room.</p>

<p>“No, you can not spare your wicked wife, John<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
Keith! Mrs. Barry has heard all!” she exclaimed,
angrily.</p>

<p>At that moment the parlor door opened quickly, and
Louise Barry, Dot, Doctor Laurens and his wife, Nina
and her husband, Mr. Wentworth, came trooping gayly
into the room from some out-door expedition that had
flushed their faces, tossed their hair, and made them
all very bright and happy.</p>

<p>Mrs. Barry raised her long, bony forefinger and
pointed angrily at Louise.</p>

<p>“There, John Keith, is your false wife,” she said
grimly. “But she is no longer niece or heiress of
mine!”</p>

</div>


<p>Perhaps Louise had dreaded this scene for years;
perhaps she had tutored herself to meet it with calmness.</p>

<p>She paused in the center of the room and contemplated
the striking scene like one thunderstruck, for
a moment, then she crossed gracefully to her aunt’s
side and grasped her arm.</p>

<p>“Dear Aunt Thalia, what does this mean? Why
is Molly Trueheart’s husband here? How <i>dare</i> he
come here?” looking expressively at Cecil.</p>

<p>He returned her glance with scorn.</p>

<p>“Spare yourself the trouble of prevarication, Miss
Barry; your treachery is fully known. Four years ago
you made my wife the heroine of a parlor scene.
Now, the tables are turned, and you find yourself in
the same position.”</p>

<p>She stared with apparent innocence at his angry
face, carefully avoiding John Keith’s eyes.</p>

<p>“I deny that I have been guilty of any treachery,”
she said defiantly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Barry caught her roughly by the shoulder and
whirled her around to face her accuser.</p>

<p>“Look at that man! Do you deny that you are his
divorced wife?” she asked scathingly.</p>

<p>Louise scanned his face with sullen fury.</p>

<p>“I deny it, yes!” she exclaimed loudly, emphatically.
“That man was once married to my step-sister, Molly
Trueheart. I have never been married at all!”</p>

<p>The loud, angry voice penetrated the back parlor,
and the child upon the floor with the book sprang up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
with a low murmur of delight. She ran to the curtains,
swept them aside with a touch of her little hand,
and bounded into the room.</p>

<p>For a moment she was disconcerted at the sight of
all those strange and wondering faces. She exclaimed
eagerly:</p>

<p>“I thought I heard mamma’s voice!”</p>

<p>The next moment she caught sight of Louise glowering
at her father, and rushed precipitately forward.</p>

<p>“Mamma! mamma!” she exclaimed joyously, and
flung her little arms fondly around the tall, stately
woman.</p>

<p>There was a minute’s intense silence as Louise’s
glaring falsehood was thus set at naught by the sweet
lips of her child.</p>

<p>Mrs. Barry, furious that she had been so deceived,
broke the hush with a sarcastic laugh.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha, not married, eh?” she cackled. “Well, I
should think you would be ashamed to own it as you
have a child to call you mother!”</p>

<p>Louise repulsed the child’s caress, and it began to
sob.</p>

<p>“Dear mamma, why are you angry, why have you
stayed so long away from your Lucy?” she cried, tearfully,
and the sight of the grieved baby face, the sound
of reproach in the child’s voice went to Louise’s heart.</p>

<p>The motherhood in her was touched irresistibly, and
after a brief struggle with herself she held out her
arms, and little Lucy sprang joyously into them, and
the mother hid her shamed face against the little, sunny
head.</p>

<p>At that sight John Keith went slowly forward and
touched her hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span></p>

<p>“Louise, be honest,” he said, huskily. “Acknowledge
now that you were once my wife, that this is our
child!”</p>

<p>Realizing that nothing else remained to her now, she
looked up and answered, sullenly:</p>

<p>“I am your wife still, John Keith, I lied to you about
the divorce. My application failed, although I sent
you a fraudulent notice that the divorce was granted.”</p>

<p>“You had better go away with him then, for you
will never be admitted into Ferndale again. You are
the first Barry that ever disgraced the family and I
wash my hands of you forever!” piped up Mrs.
Barry’s shrill treble.</p>

<p>Louise gave her an angry scowl, but John Keith
again touched her hand.</p>

<p>“Take her advice, Louise,” he said, not unkindly.
“Come away with me. Your fine friends will all desert
you now as you deserve, but I will forgive you for
our child’s sake. I can give you a home of comfort
now in the far South, and you will at least be hidden
from the sight of all those who know the history of
your wicked ambitions.”</p>

<p>She caught eagerly at the offered refuge.</p>

<p>“I will go with you,” she answered, with a shamed
and sullen air.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XLV">CHAPTER XLV.</h2>
</div>


<p>A thrill of admiration for John Keith’s magnanimity
ran along the nerves of every one, and Cecil
Laurens felt shamed and remorseful.</p>

<p>“He carries out to the letter his promise to love and
cherish her for better or worse,” he thought. “Alas,
that I did not do so with my poor little girl-bride,
whose youth might have been some excuse for her
faults. Shall I ever find her again, and, if so, will she
forgive me for my coldness and distrust?”</p>

<p>He looked fixedly at Louise, who nestled close to her
husband’s side, as if finding in his fidelity some comfort
under the storm of indignation that had burst on
her head.</p>

<p>“Madame,” he said, coldly, “perhaps you carried
your treachery so far that you were the cause of my
young wife’s flight from The Acacias. Perhaps you
could tell me, if you would, where to find her now?”</p>

<p>She started and flushed crimson, flashing him a
sullen, angry glance.</p>

<p>“I can not,” she answered, bitterly.</p>

<p>“You mean that you will not,” he said, and she
nodded defiantly.</p>

<p>“Come, Louise,” interposed her husband, “if you
know anything that will help to condone the wrong
you have done, do not withhold it. You must remember
that you are amenable to the law for your sin, although
Mr. Laurens will not prosecute you, perhaps,
if you will help him find his wronged wife.”</p>

<p>That hint was timely. It frightened the wicked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
woman, and opened her lips, despite the malice that
would have sealed them to the truth.</p>

<p>She grew pale and looked at Cecil Laurens, half
pleadingly.</p>

<p>“If I tell you all I know, will you spare me?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Very well. Your wife is in England. She had relatives
there, and when she left you she went to them.
She is living with them still, and your son, born a
few weeks after she left you, is a handsome little fellow
of four years.”</p>

<p>Cecil Laurens grew pale with emotion, and his
mother whispered to Doctor Laurens:</p>

<p>“So, I am a grandmother. I think I shall begin
to wear caps.”</p>

<p>Cecil spoke abruptly:</p>

<p>“And these relatives of my wife—humble people, of
course, but dear to me for the care they have given my
darling—their names, Mrs. Keith?”</p>

<p>She started and flushed. It was the first time since
her secret marriage, six years ago, that any one had
ever called her by her husband’s name. Conquering
the strange emotion it awoke in her breast, she answered:</p>

<p>“I do not know, but I will give you the London address
of Florine Dabol, who used to be her maid. Florine
was in my service, and helped to alienate your
wife from you and drive her away. She knew where
she went, but she kept it a secret in order to extort
money from me. I hope you will punish <i>her</i> for her
wickedness, for she has been bleeding me all these
years, until between the support of my child and paying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
her hush-money over and over, the allowance I had
from my aunt was spent, until I could barely dress
myself decently.”</p>

<p>She drew a pencil from her pocket, and rapidly,
though with a shaking hand, wrote on a slip of paper
Florine Dabol’s address.</p>

<p>“That is where I send her money,” she said, handing
it to Cecil Laurens.</p>

<p>He took it with a courteous bow and a word of
thanks.</p>

<p>“Now you have done all that you can to make
amends, Louise, we will go. Of course Mr. Laurens
will be anxious to see you gone,” said John Keith,
sadly.</p>

<p>“On the contrary, Mr. Keith, I beg that you, with
your wife and child, will accept the hospitality of
Maple Shade for tonight at least,” answered Cecil
Laurens, gravely; for he said to himself that he had
no quarrel with John Keith, who had himself endured
such bitter suffering through a woman’s ambition.</p>

<p>John Keith declined gratefully, but decisively, the
offered hospitality.</p>

<p>“We will go now,” he added.</p>

<p>Old Mrs. Barry—perhaps taking a lesson in politeness
from Cecil—said, carelessly:</p>

<p>“You may go to Ferndale, Louise, and get your
clothes and everything that belongs to you personally,
for you will never see a penny of my money.”</p>

<p>“I do not want it, for it has been the curse of my
life! It tempted me, and made me the sinner that I
am!” Louise answered, bitterly, as she turned away,
and without a word of farewell to any one, left the
house which she had entered so proudly but a little
while ago.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span></p>

<p>Perhaps the hard old aunt remembered those words
and reflected on them; for when she died, several years
later, it was found that, after a legacy of twenty thousand
dollars to Cecil Laurens’ wife, she had given
twenty thousand to John Keith, and Ferndale and all
her other estates to her grandniece, little Lucy Keith.</p>

<p>“It will keep the money in the family; and John
Keith is a good man, and deserves something for taking
Louise back after all her wickedness, and trying to
make a good woman out of such poor material,” she
wrote.</p>

<p>To her servants each she left a small legacy of five
hundred dollars, which made them very grateful and
happy; and they forgot all her faults, and lauded
“Ole Mistis” to the skies.</p>

<p>Ferndale was shut up for a long time, and then
sold, for John Keith could never bring his family back
to the county where the story of his wife’s wicked
schemes was for years a subject of gossip.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“I shall leave here as soon as I can make some arrangements
for mother and Dot,” Cecil said, when he
had bidden John Keith farewell and God-speed. “I
must lose no time in seeking my wife, and revealing to
her my knowledge of the treachery that parted us.”</p>

<p>It touched him to see his stately mother sobbing forlornly
in Dot’s sympathizing arms. He knew it was
sorrow and remorse for her hardness to his wife.</p>

<p>“Do not fret, mother. She was such a loving little
soul, I am sure she will forgive you when she finds that
you are sorry,” he said, gently.</p>

<p>“I will write to her, Cecil, as soon as you find her. I
will humble myself as I deserve to do until I win her
pardon,” she sobbed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span></p>

<p>“And I, too!” Mrs. Barry exclaimed, dashing a suspicious
moisture from her eyes. “Dear girl! I always
loved her until Louise set me against her. I
would have pardoned her that night when she asked
me so sweetly, only my wicked niece hustled me out
of the room before I could answer the poor child!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XLVI">CHAPTER XLVI.</h2>
</div>


<p>A few days after, Cecil was <i>en route</i> for England.
Doctor Laurens and his wife bore him company, for
the young doctor was anxious to aid in the search for
his sister-in-law, in whom he had had such loyal
faith so long.</p>

<p>Arrived in London, they put up as usual at their favorite
Langham, and the gentlemen sallied forth in
search of Florine Dabol.</p>

<p>At the address Louise had given them they found
her parents—a decrepit pair of old French people.</p>

<p>Florine was down in the country they said. She was
lady’s maid to a great, rich lady, but she had never told
them her name. Their daughter came to see them
about twice a year, and gave them money to live on,
but they never wrote letters to her nor received any
communication from her in the interim.</p>

<p>Cecil went away in despair. What should he do
now? He had given an address to the old couple, and
told them to send word when their daughter came, but
how could he wait so long in the fever of remorse, unrest
and longing that possessed him?</p>

<p>Surely it was his good angel that made him meet
Lord Westerley coming out of a fashionable club.</p>

<p>The urbane nobleman was delighted at the <i>rencontre</i>
with Doctor Charley, but he was decidedly stiff with
Cecil, who in his preoccupation did not observe the
coolness.</p>

<p>“Everybody is out of town,” he said, shrugging his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
shoulders in the chill November air. “I brought
Madelon up from the country this morning for a few
days’ shopping. You will come and dine with us this
evening?”</p>

<p>Cecil was about to decline, but his brother hastily
accepted. When they had parted from Lord Westerley
he said:</p>

<p>“Perhaps Lady Westerley can find out where Florine
is staying.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Somehow Cecil got a good chance to confide all his
painful story to the beautiful lady who had been his
wife’s dearest friend. She listened to him with emotion.
The tears even fell from her beautiful eyes.</p>

<p>“But these are tears of joy,” she said, pensively. “I
am so glad that the martyrdom of that dear girl is
over, and that you had some cause for your apparent
heartlessness. Florine Dabol, yes, I can tell you where
she is!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Lady Westerley.”</p>

<p>She smiled at the interruption, but continued:</p>

<p>“She is down in the country at The Oaks, our ancestral
home. You are aware, Mr. Laurens, that my
father and mother both are dead, and that Sir Edward’s
grandson has come into the title and estates.
Well, Florine is maid to the heir’s mother, my beautiful
niece, Ernestine Trueheart.”</p>

<p>She glanced at him sharply as she pronounced the
name, but it did not seem to strike his attention.</p>

<p>“I shall go down there tonight,” he said, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” she replied, with a merry laugh.
“You would arrive there in the middle of the night.
Wait until the morning train. When you get to The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
Oaks ask for Mrs. Trueheart. When she comes to you
tell her what you want of the maid and you will get
your wish.”</p>

<p>He obeyed Lady Westerley’s instructions to the
letter. He waited till the morning train. When they
reached the station where his journey ended he took
a shabby fly to The Oaks.</p>

<p>“The lady of The Oaks must excuse the dust of
travel. I am too impatient to linger a moment,” he
thought.</p>

<p>They drove several miles through one of the most
beautiful estates in the country, and at length drew
up before a magnificent abode, one of “The stately
homes of England.” He paid the driver and dismissed
him.</p>

<p>The sun shone brightly on the terraced walks as he
proceeded on his way, but suddenly he came to a dead
stop and cried out in surprise.</p>

<p>He had come face to face with a woman and a little
boy—a lad with a handsome, spirited face, blue eyes,
and chestnut curls. It struck him as strangely familiar.</p>

<p>“Phebe, what are you doing here?” he exclaimed in
wonder.</p>

<p>It was the maid whom he had discharged at Louise
Barry’s instigation. She had not forgotten her wrongs,
for she answered, sullenly, as soon as she recognized
him:</p>

<p>“I’m nurse to the heir, Mr. Laurens—little Sir Cecil
Trueheart!”</p>

<p>He brushed past her, with a smothered sigh to the
memory of his wife, and went up the broad stone
steps. Presently he found himself waiting in a stately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
reception-room for the coming of the mistress of The
Oaks.</p>

<p>While he waited, he stood at the window watching
Phebe and her little charge as they strolled upon the
terrace. He murmured to himself, with a thrill of
pride:</p>

<p>“Somewhere in England, I have a little son as beautiful
and noble, doubtless, as this little heir of a noble
line.”</p>

<p>The door opened. A graceful lady in lustrous blue
velvet came slowly toward him over the velvet carpet.</p>

<p>At first sight of her there flashed over him the
words of the young English girl, his brother’s wife:</p>

<p>“The most beautiful lady in England!”</p>

<p>Dark, curling hair, dark, dreamy eyes, and a face the
saddest his eyes had ever seen. She came slowly on
until they were face to face, then a cry of passionate
joy came from the lips of each:</p>

<p>“My wife!”</p>

<p>“My husband!”</p>

<p>The hour for which she had hoped and longed had
come at last. She knew that the truth had come to him
somehow, and that the long, sad parting was over for
aye. Holding her close in his arms, he told her all.
She rang the bell for Florine Dabol, but, seeing Cecil
Laurens coming into the house, the wily maid had
guessed all. She had instantly fled; and she was clever
enough to remain hidden forever from those she had
helped Louise to separate.</p>

<p>“My darling, you will forgive me all, even the cruel
sneers at your mother, so bitterly repented now?” he
said, humbly.</p>

<p>Tears sprang to her eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span></p>

<p>“Cecil, my mother was an angel,” she said, tenderly.
“Although she was an actress, she was not of low birth
as Mrs. Barry told you. She was an earnest Christian,
too, and I am sure that when she was instantly killed
by a railroad collision her pure soul went straight to
Heaven. But this is too sad to dwell upon. Come
and let me show you our beautiful little son, Sir Cecil.”</p>
